<h2 id="c1">FOREWORD</h2>
<h3 title="">DOGS WHO SET BLIND MEN FREE</h3>
<p>In Morristown, New Jersey, there is what is
probably the most remarkable school in the
world&mdash;a school where dogs are educated to
liberate physically the blind people of our country.
This school is called The Seeing Eye and was
founded in 1928 by a woman whose life and wealth
has been devoted to this remarkable cause; her name
is Mrs. Harrison Eustis.</p>
<p>Female German shepherd dogs are chosen for
this work because they are not easily distracted
from the duties entrusted to them. It takes from
three to five months to complete a dog&rsquo;s education.
The first few months are spent with her instructor:
she learns to pick up whatever he drops; learns that
if she walks off a curb without first stopping, he
stumbles and falls; that if she passes under a low
obstruction, he hits his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>It is very hard to find men with sufficient patience
to learn how to educate these dogs and it is equally
as difficult to teach the blind how to rely upon and
use these dogs.</p>
<h3 title="">HOW THE DOG WORKS</h3>
<p>The method by which the dog and man work
together is simple. The dog guide does not take
her master to his destination without being told
where to go. It is not generally appreciated, but
blind people develop an adequate mental picture of
their own communities. All they need is a means
by which they may be guided around <i>their</i> picture.
In a strange city they ask directions as anyone else
would. It is simple to remember the blocks and to
remember also when to go right or left. In familiar
territory people with eyesight do not look for the
name of every street. The master directs his dog by
oral commands of &ldquo;right,&rdquo; &ldquo;left&rdquo; or &ldquo;forward.&rdquo;
But it is the dog that guides the master. By means
of the handle of the leather harness which he holds
lightly in his left hand, she takes him around pedestrians,
sidewalk obstructions, automobiles, anything
which may interfere with his safe progress.
The pace is rapid, rather faster than that of the
average pedestrian. Upon arriving at street crossings
the dog guides her master to the edge of the
curb and stops. He finds the edge immediately
with his foot or cane and then gives his guide the
necessary command for the direction in which he
wishes to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>The dog can be depended upon to do her part.
Her lessons have been thorough, particularly those
which teach her to think for herself. She must
pass the school&rsquo;s rigid &ldquo;blindfold&rdquo; test in which her
instructor&rsquo;s eyes are bandaged so that he is, for
practical purposes, blind. She is then tested under
the most difficult conditions, on streets and intersections
and in the heaviest of pedestrian and auto
traffic. She does not look at traffic lights but at
traffic. When she passes she can be certified as
ready for her blind master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Not every blind person can use a dog guide.
Some are too young, many too old. Some do not
like dogs. But conservative estimates indicate that
there are about 10,000 in America who would
benefit through a dog guide. It is understandable
that leading workers for the blind, business men and
women, are urging The Seeing Eye to extend its
facilities as rapidly as is consistent with the maintenance
of the highest possible standards.</p>
<h3 title="">THE ESSENTIALS TO SUCCESS</h3>
<p>There are no secrets which The Seeing Eye uses
to make the shepherd an effective guide, but there
are several essentials to success. The first is experience.
The knowledge gained by the years of work
which have gone into the development of The Seeing
Eye is called upon in the education of every
student. A second essential is that the carefully
selected dog is educated, not trained. She is taught
to think for herself and in her instruction learns
certain principles which she can apply to problems
she will meet later. If she reacted only to commands
she would be useless in guiding blind people.
Another essential is the fact that she loves to work.
To her, service is a pleasure and not a duty. Her
master&rsquo;s hours are hers. Her main compensation
is her master&rsquo;s affection and his utter reliance on
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Blind students, men and women, come to the
school in classes of eight, the maximum an instructor
is able to teach at one time. While their major
objective is to learn through practice and instruction
how to direct the dog and follow her guidance,
some of them must learn other things, too. Many
of them since blindness have lost the faculty of finding
their way in known surroundings. Others have
fallen into the habit of shuffling feet and groping
walk, with body bent forward and hands outstretched.
Some never have walked down stairs
unaided. These are things which must be unlearned
if the dog is to bring independence. At
The Seeing Eye the student is taught to free himself
from these habits of helplessness, so that self-reliance
and courage gradually return. Anticipation
replaces despair as the dog opens a new world
for her master, one he dreamed of but never hoped
to have again.</p>
<p>All the practice work of the student with his dog
takes place on the streets of Morristown. Here,
morning and afternoon each day, the student gradually
assimilates his lessons. Near the end of his
month&rsquo;s course he is able to go easily and fearlessly
about the city without an instructor, just
as he will in his various activities on his return
home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<h3 title="">THE DOG AND HER MASTER ARE INSEPARABLE</h3>
<p>From the time the student is assigned his dog, the
two are inseparable. No one else feeds or cares for
her and within a few days the two are bound together
by a mutual affection&mdash;a tie which remains
unbroken throughout the years of the dog&rsquo;s working
life. Even about the house, where no guiding is
necessary, dog and man are constantly together just
because they want to be. She even sleeps close by
her master&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<h3 title="">NOTE</h3>
<p>For the sake of the story certain qualities have
been given &ldquo;Lady&rdquo; which are found in individual
German shepherd dogs, though never present in a
blind leader.</p>

<h2 id="c2">THEFT IN THE RAIN</h2>
<p>Joe Morrow, very sleepy, grew conscious
of voices coming up from the porch&mdash;the slow
drawl of his uncle, Dr. David Stone, and a
quicker, sharper voice. Abruptly the sharper tone
scratched at his memory and the drowsiness was
gone. What was Harley Kent doing here? So far
as he knew the man had never visited the house
before, and his uncle had never set foot on the Kent
place a quarter of a mile down the road. A word,
stark and clear, came through the bedroom window.
Robbery! And suddenly he was out of bed
and slipping into his clothes.</p>
<p>The morning was cool and fresh after the heavy
rain of the night. His uncle stood at the porch railing,
sightless eyes turned off across the valley, a
great, tawny German shepherd dog at his side.
Harley Kent crowded the top step, and Joe noticed
that the dog sneezed, and grew restless, and drew
back a step.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, easy.&rdquo; Dr. Stone&rsquo;s hand felt for the
dog&rsquo;s head and rubbed a twitching ear. &ldquo;When did
you say it was discovered, Kent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little after six o&rsquo;clock this morning. The
maid found a window open and called me. The
wall safe was open, too, and the necklace was gone.
Could I trouble you for a match, Doctor? I&rsquo;ve
lost my lighter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stepped upon the porch, and the dog
sneezed again and retreated. Dr. Stone brought
forth matches, and Harley Kent had to come close
to get them. Joe was vaguely conscious that his
uncle&rsquo;s face had become intent.</p>
<p>Harley Kent lit a cigar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the habit
of keeping jewels in the house. Mrs. Kent&rsquo;s been
in Europe; her ship docks next Monday. We&rsquo;re to
attend a dinner that night, and I knew she&rsquo;d want
the necklace. I took it out of a safe deposit box a
week ago and brought it home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone asked a question. &ldquo;Insured, of course?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Certainly. Twenty-five thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>The boy sucked in his breath and wondered what
twenty-five thousand dollars would look like piled
up in shining half dollars. The Kent automobile
gleamed in front of the house, and a uniformed
chauffeur sat motionless behind the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve notified the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to, but the storm last night crippled our
telephone line. I came over to use yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ours is out, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley Kent made an impatient gesture. &ldquo;That
means I&rsquo;ll have to run into the village.&rdquo; The cigar
came out of his mouth. &ldquo;It was an inside job,
Doctor. Whoever robbed that safe knew how to
get into it. It was opened by combination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone said coolly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s putting it on your
own doorstep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley Kent shrugged. &ldquo;Figure it out for yourself.
There were only three of us in the house&mdash;Donovan,
the chauffeur, the maid, and myself.
Two days ago I forgot to take some papers to New
York. I telephoned Donovan to bring them in.
They were in the safe and I had to give him the
combination. Well, I&rsquo;m off for the village. I
understand you were a police surgeon before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
The man coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. Stone without emotion. &ldquo;Before
I lost my sight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;d like to run over and get the feel
of a case again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be interesting,&rdquo; the doctor said slowly.</p>
<p>Harley Kent went down the steps, a door
slammed, and the car rolled away. Joe had a
glimpse of the uniformed figure at the wheel, and
spoke in a hoarse whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Donovan be put in jail, Uncle David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; The hand came up from the dog&rsquo;s
head and tapped the porch railing thoughtfully.
&ldquo;What time is it, Joe? About eight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hours,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said as though speaking
to himself. Abruptly he jerked his head. &ldquo;Time
we had breakfast,&rdquo; he added, and boy and dog followed
at his heels. Here, in the home of his
widowed sister that had sheltered him for five years,
he knew his way perfectly, and there was nothing
to mark him out as blind as he walked boldly toward
the dining room. And yet at the last moment, his
handicap touched him with uncertainty. He had
to put out his hand to make sure of the table and
then fumble for his chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Joe wondered about jails, and was sorry for
Donovan. Twice the man had picked him up on
the road and carried him into the village, and once he
had spent a fascinating afternoon in the Kent garage
holding tools while the chauffeur worked on the car.
Did they lock a prisoner in a cell and keep him there
night and day?</p>
<p>His mother&rsquo;s voice cut through his thoughts.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going over, David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a reason for wanting to go,&rdquo; the man said.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s heart throbbed. A reason for going. His
throat was husky again. &ldquo;Right away, Uncle
David? A policeman has to get there while the trail
is hot, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some trails,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said in his slow
drawl, &ldquo;that do not grow cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out on the porch he filled a pipe and smoked
quietly. Joe, watching that lion head topped by
crisp, unruly white hair, wondered if his uncle ever
became excited. He fidgeted and watched a clock;
and by and by Dr. Stone knocked the ashes from his
pipe, stood up, and took a dog&rsquo;s harness down from
a nail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>The dog stretched its great body and held out its
head. A stiff leash rose from either side of the harness
and joined a wide, hard handle-grip at the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, forward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, protectingly, the massive animal took Dr.
Stone down the steps and along the concrete walk to
the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without hesitation the dog turned right, the
tawny body pressed almost against the man&rsquo;s left
leg. They were off now, and Dr. Stone&rsquo;s body bent
slightly from the waist toward the dog, while his
right hand lightly swung a cane. He might have
been gifted with sight, so rapidly did he walk, so
complete was his confidence in his four-footed
guide. Joe had to stretch his legs to keep up with
them. They went past fields and orchards, fences
and tangles of wild grape. The doctor&rsquo;s cane,
swinging along, came in contact at last, with a wall
of hedge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kent&rsquo;s place, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Joe&rsquo;s throat throbbed with a twitching
pulse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>A telephone repair truck was in the driveway.
The dog slowed, and swung aside, pulling on the
leash and changing his course. Without hesitation
Dr. Stone followed the pull, and the dog led him
around and past the truck. They appeared, in their
movements, to be one.</p>
<p>The boy said: &ldquo;I like to watch him do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my eyes, Joe. Kent&rsquo;s car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; a telephone truck. I don&rsquo;t see his car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not back yet,&rdquo; said the doctor, and whistled
soundlessly. They roamed the grounds. The dog
at a rapid pace, took the man along one side of the
house and deftly manoeuvered him around every
tree and bush. In the rear a maid hung a sodden
garment on the line and, after a frightened glance
at them, disappeared into the house. The wind
blew across the valley and the wet sleeve of a coat
fluttered and swung toward Dr. Stone&rsquo;s face. He
reached out a groping hand, and found the sleeve,
and brought it close to his sightless eyes as though
trying to pierce a veil of darkness and make out the
pattern. Bees droned through a blooming lilac and
they moved around to the other side of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, is there a pine tree on the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pin pricks ran along the boy&rsquo;s spine. His uncle
had never been here before&mdash;how did he know
about the tree? &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A large tree, heavy-branched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me there. Lady, forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cane explored the trunk and then slowly
tapped the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About six feet from the house, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe blinked. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sound echoes,&rdquo; Dr. Stone chuckled. Automobile
tires ground the gravel of the driveway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Kent,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>Harley Kent hurried up to them. &ldquo;Is this village
supposed to have a police force?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Had to wait half an hour for Captain Tucker to
stroll back from breakfast. There could be a dozen
murders committed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off. &ldquo;Just a
moment, Doctor, and I&rsquo;ll be with you. It occurs to
me I may have left that lighter in another suit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maid hung one out to dry,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo; Harley Kent stopped short.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he added, and was gone. Presently he
was back. &ldquo;Not there. I suppose it will turn up
some place. Well, come in; come in. The police
should be here before long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>They mounted to the porch and Lady, after the
manner of her breed when trained to work with the
blind, stopped with her head directly under the
knob of the strange door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A remarkable animal,&rdquo; Harley Kent said in admiration.
&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s where the job was done,
Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe was conscious of strange tremors. Lady,
alert, cocked her head and sniffed the air with an
inquiring nose. The doctor, halting in the arched
doorway leading from the hall, seemed to lose himself
in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a door to the left of this room, Kent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it leads into the dining room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And windows in the wall facing this way.
They&rsquo;re open now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley Kent gave a startled grunt. &ldquo;Doctor, if
I didn&rsquo;t know you were blind&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air currents,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said laconically. &ldquo;I
feel them on my face. You feel them, too, but they
go unnoticed. You rely on your eyes. The wall
safe, then, should be in the solid wall on the right.
Correct, Kent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; Harley Kent said, still
startled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>The doctor asked an abrupt question. &ldquo;How
high is that safe from the floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six feet, eight inches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To work the combination without straining a
short man would have to stand upon a chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Doctor. None of the chairs was disturbed;
none of the cushions trampled. I checked
that with the maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone&rsquo;s face was impassive. &ldquo;I gather that
means something to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would it mean to you if I told you Donovan
was a tall man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s sightless eyes were fixed straight
ahead as though he saw something that was denied
to other men. &ldquo;Does Donovan know he&rsquo;s suspected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t quite a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man passed quickly through the hall. Donovan!
Joe instinctively stepped closer to the dog.
And suddenly, under his feet, the floor boards
creaked with a loud, harsh, dry protest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Loose boards all over the room,&rdquo; Harley Kent
explained. &ldquo;I never bothered to have them nailed
down. With the safe in this room I looked upon
them as a burglar alarm. And yet, in the uproar of
last night&rsquo;s storm, a cannon ball might have been
rolled across the floor and nobody upstairs would
have heard it.&rdquo; His hands made a resigned gesture
of defeat. &ldquo;No matter how sound you think your
plans are, you can never be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said slowly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s always a
slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone truck was gone, and now another
car came up the driveway and stopped with a squeal
of brakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Tucker has evidently finished his
breakfast at last,&rdquo; Harley Kent said with bitter sarcasm.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll want to question Donovan. If you
don&rsquo;t mind, Doctor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; The doctor took an uncertain step
and paused. &ldquo;I seem to have lost my bearings, Kent.
Would you give me your arm to the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe followed blankly. It was the first time he
had ever known his uncle to lose a sense of direction
once established. Behind those blind eyes the
room, in all its essentials, had been mapped. And
even if its outlines had not been printed on a clear
mind, the man had only to say, &ldquo;Lady, out!&rdquo; and
the dog would have taken him to the door. Why
take Harley Kent&rsquo;s arm?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Captain Tucker, on the porch, spoke a greeting
and passed inside. The door closed. Down at the
end of the gravel where the driveway met the road,
Joe instinctively turned toward home. But Dr.
Stone said, &ldquo;Lady, right!&rdquo; and was off toward the
village at that amazingly rapid pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m after pipe tobacco, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s shorter legs beat a rapid tattoo on the
dirt road. &ldquo;I bought you some yesterday, Uncle
David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An extra tin won&rsquo;t go to waste,&rdquo; the man said
casually.</p>
<p>Hedge and brush were full of fascinating odors
that invited sniffing examination. But the shepherd
dog, as though aware that the man who gripped the
handle was in her keeping, went ahead with single-minded
purpose. The dirt road became a paved
street and they were in the town. Lady guided her
charge toward the sidewalk, came to a cautious halt
at the curb and waited for her command.</p>
<p>A voice called: &ldquo;Dr. Stone! Dr. Stone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Joe saw that it was Tom Bloodgood, the jeweler.
They waited, and Lady sat down on her haunches,
watchful and alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard about the robbery out your way, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d never expect to happen.
I can&rsquo;t understand how a burglar could have got
across that room without waking the dead. The
way that floor creaked&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kent says the storm drowned all other noise.&rdquo;
The doctor&rsquo;s mouth had grown hard at the corners.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you and Kent were on visiting
terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you knew about those floor boards&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! That was a business call&mdash;the only time I
was in the house. He sent for me last Wednesday&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice stopped, and Joe found the jeweler&rsquo;s
eyes resting on him meaningly. Flushing, the boy
took himself out of earshot and pretended to be
absorbed in a store window. Presently his uncle
called to him, and they went down the street to
Stevenson&rsquo;s shop, and Joe saw that the tight lines
around the man&rsquo;s mouth had showed much deeper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Back on the street the blind man was silent, and
walked with quick steps beside the dog. Half way
home a cloud of dust rode toward them, and Captain
Tucker&rsquo;s car came out of the dust. The car
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t arrest Donovan,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
<p>The police officer leaned across the wheel. &ldquo;Joe
must have told you he&rsquo;s not in the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody had to tell me,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said mildly.
&ldquo;Captain Tucker, with a jewel thief in charge,
would not be likely to stop for a chat with a friend.
You didn&rsquo;t arrest Donovan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no. Even though you&rsquo;re reasonably sure
a man&rsquo;s guilty, you can&rsquo;t arrest him for robbery unless
you have at least some proof. There is no
proof&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing. And he has an alibi. He
and the maid have their rooms in the same wing of
the house. She says she couldn&rsquo;t sleep last night,
and sat up and read with her door partly open. She
insists Donovan couldn&rsquo;t pass that door without
being seen or heard. If the maid&rsquo;s telling the truth,
Donovan couldn&rsquo;t be the thief; if she isn&rsquo;t telling
the truth, they&rsquo;re both in it. Anyway, if we do
arrest Donovan, what about the necklace? If possible
we want to recover that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you think Donovan did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Doctor, let&rsquo;s give it a look. She admits
she never sat up all night reading before. She can&rsquo;t
recollect ever leaving her door open before. Now,
why did both those things have to happen last night
when the safe was robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds rather convenient,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too convenient. Too perfect. My idea is
that Donovan did the job and the maid is hiding
him. I can figure it all out, but I can&rsquo;t pin it on
them. That girl&rsquo;s too slick for me. I&rsquo;m going to
call in State troopers. Maybe they&rsquo;ll be able to
break down her story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car was gone with a whine of gears, and Joe
stretched his legs and followed his uncle and the
dog. Harley Kent&rsquo;s car stood in the driveway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at the Kent place, Uncle David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; the doctor said cryptically, &ldquo;it is
best to leave a plum hang until it falls.&rdquo; The cane
made a brisk gesture. &ldquo;Tonight, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>To the boy the night was a long way off. A
crime had been committed in the neighborhood,
almost under their noses, and the scene of the crime
drew him with an excited, morbid curiosity. Late
in the afternoon he walked back to the Kent place
and loitered outside the hedge. He was there when
a car drove in and two State troopers got out. Lean
and trim in their belted uniforms, they looked competent
and formidable; and his eyes, fascinated,
clung to the bulges at their hips. An hour later
they came out of the house, and Donovan was with
them. The chauffeur was still with them when the
car rolled away.</p>
<p>Joe ran for home. &ldquo;Uncle David! They&rsquo;ve arrested
Donovan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tucker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; State troopers. I saw them take him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected it,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said mildly. Joe,
watching him, was presently aware that he slept
peacefully in the depths of the porch chair. So can
the blind, shut out from the light of the world, in
turn shut out the world and drop off into almost
instant slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>But at supper time the man was vividly awake.
The strong, supple hands that had made him a surgeon,
were suddenly restless and nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;change those hard leather shoes
to soft sneakers. Leather soles make too much
noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order had a sound of mystery and adventure.
Joe raced upstairs to his room. When he came
down the day was gone and darkness lay over the
countryside. Lady was already harnessed. Out in
the road the boy held to his uncle&rsquo;s arm and hurried
along. Here, walking into a wall of night, he
would by himself have to go slowly. But to his uncle
the night presented no change, nor did it bring
up any new handicap. For to Dr. Stone the world
was always dark and black. There was no day or
night.</p>
<p>Kent&rsquo;s car was gone from the driveway. Dr.
Stone said: &ldquo;Easy, Joe; walk on the grass. Any
lights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to the boy that his uncle made a sound
of satisfaction. The dog, as though sensing the
man&rsquo;s desire for caution, led them slowly, silently.
Dr. Stone&rsquo;s cane touched the tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lady!&rdquo; His voice was low.</p>
<p>The dog was all attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, search. Fetch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe was conscious of the black bulk of the house,
a black tower that was the tree, and a blurred
shadow moving noiselessly in the grass. Minutes
passed, and his heart pounded in his chest. One
moment the dog was near him, and the next it was
gone. And then the shadow stood motionless beside
his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, again,&rdquo; Dr. Stone urged. &ldquo;Search.
Fetch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For what? Joe racked his brain and tried to find
an answer. Once he heard the soft sniff of the dog,
but could not see it. Suddenly it was beside his
uncle again, motionless as before. How long it had
been there he did not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to the house now,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said.</p>
<p>They crossed to the porch and rang the bell. The
living room was all at once alight, and Harley Kent
opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you might be along, Doctor. Come
in; come in. It looks as though we&rsquo;ve cleared this
thing up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then the necklace was recovered?&rdquo; Dr. Stone
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not exactly. They&rsquo;ll sweat Donovan and
make him come through. They took him away
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I heard,&rdquo; the doctor said without emotion.
&ldquo;Under arrest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Technically, no. They took him down for
questioning, but&mdash;you know how those things are
worked. Keep after him until he opens up and then
book him. The maid slipped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They dragged it out of her a little at a
time. Donovan wanted her to marry him. Yesterday
he urged her to marry him and leave for the
West at once. That sounded suspicious, Doctor.
With so many now out of work, why should a man
marry and at once throw up his job? To do this
he&rsquo;d have to have quite a bit of money&mdash;and Donovan
didn&rsquo;t have any. Or else he&rsquo;d have to know
how he could raise money very quickly. Get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So we sent out the maid and brought in Donovan.
He had a smug answer to the reason for that
trip to the West. A friend owned a taxi company
in a western city and wanted him to come on and
take the job of manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had this friend&rsquo;s letter, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley Kent laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not as easily
fooled as that, Doctor? Of course not. Said he had
lost it. So the troopers took him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said after a silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And a lucky thing the girl talked.
Up to that point we had nothing. No finger prints,
no sign as to how the window had been forced,
no sign of the necklace. Nothing but an open
window and an open safe. It was as though a bird
had flown in and had flown off with the jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bird,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said slowly, and tapped his
cane against the floor. &ldquo;Nobody thought of that
seriously though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bird?&rdquo; Harley Kent stared.</p>
<p>To Joe&rsquo;s amazement, his uncle appeared in earnest.
&ldquo;Because if they had taken a bird seriously the
next step&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next step what?&rdquo; Harley Kent demanded
sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>The cane had ceased to tap the floor. &ldquo;The next
step,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said softly, &ldquo;would be to look
where a bird would naturally fly with such a
bauble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something electric, something unsaid, hung in the
air, and Joe shook with a strange chill. Whatever
that something was, it spoke to Lady. The dog grew
restless and growled in its throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll be going, Kent,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Harley Kent.</p>
<p>Joe clung to his uncle&rsquo;s arm and swallowed with
difficulty. A hundred feet down the road the man
halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see the house from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me when the downstairs lights go out.&rdquo;
The man found his pipe and struck a match to the
bowl.</p>
<p>A whippoorwill called musically through the
night, and distance softened the hoot of an owl.
Frogs croaked in a meadow and a rabbit stirred in
the brush. Joe shifted from foot to foot, and
wondered what was to come next. Twice cars
passed them going into town, and off over the hill
a dog howled. And then, without warning, the
oblongs of downstairs windows disappeared and the
roof was a dark patch against the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The lights are out,&rdquo; the boy whispered.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone put away the pipe. &ldquo;Joe, you&rsquo;d better
run home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy had not expected this. &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Joe. I can handle this better alone. You
might only be in the way. Run along, and I&rsquo;ll tell
you all about it in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ifs. Lady&rsquo;s here, and I&rsquo;ll be perfectly all
right. Off, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word the boy trudged away.
Once he looked back, and could just distinguish his
uncle&rsquo;s form. Again he looked back, and man and
dog were gone. His steps slowed and ceased. He
stood listening.</p>
<p>The whippoorwill had ceased to call, and only the
chorus of frogs broke the stillness of the night. By
and by he moved again, back the way he had come.
The sneaks made his progress almost soundless. Had
Uncle David told him to wear them so that they
could go unnoticed to the pine tree? Why the
tree?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Man and dog were gone from where he had left
them. The tree lingered in his mind. Avoiding
the driveway he crept across the grass. A dark
pillar, darker than the night, loomed ahead. It was
the tree. He dropped to the ground and, hugging
his knees, sat there and was almost afraid to breathe.</p>
<p>There was no moon, and the gloom was filled
with subtle alarms. Donovan was probably in a
cell, caged and helpless. What would happen to
the maid? And why that intangible something that
had hung between Uncle David and Harley Kent?
He grew cramped and shifted his position. It must
be late. Where was his uncle? He strained his eyes
toward the tree but could see nothing.</p>
<p>Suddenly every faculty was sharpened and drawn
tight. He thought he had heard a sound. Slowly
he relaxed. It must have been the wind. And then
he heard it again. This time there could be no mistake.
There had been a subdued, almost indistinct
scraping.</p>
<p>Silence again, and darkness, and that vague alarm.
The silence grew painful. A leaf, fluttering down,
touched his face and a chill ran through his bones.
Why should a leaf fall from a tree in early spring?
And then the stillness was broken by a ringing call:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Kent, it&rsquo;s no go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice strangled and strained, came down out of
the tree. &ldquo;Who the devil are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Stone. You can&rsquo;t get away with it, Kent.
Tell them any story you like, but be sure you have
Donovan released at once. Lady, home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man and dog emerged out of the night, and Joe
flattened out and hugged the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Joe,&rdquo; the doctor said.</p>
<p>The boy stood up, abashed, and took his uncle&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;How did you know I was there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ears&mdash;a blind man&rsquo;s ears. When you came in
Lady remained quiet. That meant she recognized
someone she trusted. There could be only one answer&mdash;you.
Do you realize you might have ruined
everything? That&rsquo;s why I sent you home. One
suspicious sound from outside the house and our
quarry might have taken alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe wet his lips. &ldquo;It was Mr. Kent?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Donovan? I had my doubts from
the start. Kent told a smooth story. He had had to
give Donovan the combination, and the safe had
been opened by combination. It was a tall man&rsquo;s
safe, and Donovan was a tall man. It fitted together
perfectly, Joe&mdash;too perfectly. Remember when I
asked Kent to lead me to the door? I wanted to learn
something&mdash;and I learned it. Kent is a tall man, too.
I might have asked you, but to a boy all men seem
tall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maid&rsquo;s story was perfect, too,&rdquo; Joe said
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two perfect stories,&rdquo; Dr. Stone agreed. &ldquo;It
became a matter of picking the true from the false,
and Kent rang false from the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand, Uncle David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s analyze it. When Kent came to the house
Lady sneezed and drew away. Two weeks ago I
upset a bottle of bay rum; it ran into her eyes and
nose. She&rsquo;s been shy of bay rum since. When
Kent said he&rsquo;d lost his lighter and asked for a match
he reeked with bay rum and talcum. The maid had
awakened him at six o&rsquo;clock, and he reached our
house at eight. Two striking facts, Joe. Does a
man, finding his house robbed in the night, calmly
go upstairs and make a careful toilet? Does he wait
two hours before going to a telephone to call the
police?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we went to his place. He wasn&rsquo;t home,
and we wandered about the grounds. That was
pure luck. We found the wet suit. I asked you
if there was a pine tree on the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Uncle David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because that suit reeked with pine. We found
that the tree was only six feet from the house and
heavy-branched, which meant that some of the
branches grew close to the house. And so now we
had a robbery in the rain, a pine tree, and a dripping
suit of Harley Kent&rsquo;s that reeked with pine. The
facts were all unrelated, but I began to wonder if the
tree had played a part in the robbery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Kent came back, and his first thought was
to look in the wet suit for the missing lighter. When
I mentioned the suit on the line he said nothing to
indicate alarm. But a blind man&rsquo;s ears are sharp.
They are quick to catch shades of sound in a voice.
I knew he was disturbed because we had chanced
upon that suit. Now, why should he be upset?
Wet clothing is not uncommon after a wild rainstorm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We went to town for tobacco, and ran into Tom
Bloodgood. That was another stroke of luck. For
Bloodgood told me Kent had called him to the house
to value a necklace. The jewelry market has fallen
this last year, and Tom gave Kent a valuation of
about $15,000. The moment Bloodgood told me
that I thought I saw the picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kent&rsquo;s a market speculator. Evidently he had
been hit and needed money. Apparently he didn&rsquo;t
want to have the necklace appraised in New York
where he was fairly well known&mdash;such things leak
out and sometimes affect a man&rsquo;s credit. After he
learned what the necklace would bring in the market
he must have done some thinking. If he sold it,
he&rsquo;d realize $15,000. If it were stolen he&rsquo;d collect
$25,000 from the insurance company. The reason
he had shaved and waited two hours to call the
police took on significance. It began to look as
though Kent had staged a convenient robbery.
Collect for the jewels and still have them. Later he
might break up the necklace and sell the pearls
separately. It&rsquo;s been done before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell Captain Tucker, Uncle
David?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Tucker would have immediately
searched the tree, and Kent could have got the
incriminating suit out of the way and made the
charge that Donovan had hidden the necklace in the
pine. There was only one way. Scare Kent. Send
him out into the tree in a panic. And then catch
him in the act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So tonight we called upon Kent. I was searching
for a way to alarm him, and he opened the door
himself by mentioning birds. The moment I spoke
of a search of a tree he froze. After that it was
merely a matter of waiting for him to come forth
to remove the proof of his guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were almost at Joe&rsquo;s house. The boy
turned a puzzled thought in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Uncle David&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if there was pine on his coat it wouldn&rsquo;t be
proof he&rsquo;d been in a pine tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; Dr. Stone agreed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what sent
me searching for the absolute proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Light broke upon the boy. &ldquo;I see it now. You
found something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This.&rdquo; The man held out his hand.</p>
<p>In the darkness the boy could not see what lay in
the hand. &ldquo;What is it, Uncle David?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The missing cigar lighter,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said
quietly. &ldquo;It fell out of Kent&rsquo;s pocket while he was
hiding the jewels. Lady found it for me under the
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<h2 id="c3">VOICES IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Go on ahead, Joe,&rdquo; Dr. David Stone said. &ldquo;The
boat will probably need bailing. I&rsquo;ll have
Jerry fix your rod. Won&rsquo;t take ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Morrow gripped the can of worms and was
gone. Dr. Stone said, &ldquo;Right, Lady,&rdquo; and, gripping
the harness-handle, followed the dog toward Jerry
Moore&rsquo;s garage.</p>
<p>Sound came to the doctor&rsquo;s ears&mdash;the rasp of a
tool and, abruptly, the sharp tapping of a finger
against glass. The dog deftly steered him around
an automobile. Jerry&rsquo;s voice came from under the
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought those were Lady&rsquo;s paws. With you in
a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone moved toward the little office. A voice
said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s blind, Rog.&rdquo; The tapping had stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>But well able to hear, the doctor thought with
grim humor, and listened from the doorway. Voices
came from the garage floor&mdash;Jerry Moore&rsquo;s, the
nervous voice that had said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s blind, Rog,&rdquo;
and the mellow, genial tones of a third man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This brake-rod&rdquo;&mdash;grunt&mdash;&ldquo;sure was loose.&rdquo;
That was Jerry. &ldquo;Quite a contraption you&rsquo;ve got
under here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own idea,&rdquo; the genial voice said. &ldquo;Why
smear up a car when you can pack them where
they&rsquo;re out of the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The job was done, and presently the car backed
out of the garage. Jerry came to the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What won&rsquo;t folks think up next?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Fishing fellows, those two who just went out.
Stopping off to try Horseshoe Lake. Got a long
metal box bolted in under the floor boards. Out of
sight and out of the way. Got room in that box for
a hundred pounds along with ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked a trifle sharply.</p>
<p>The garageman cackled. &ldquo;Sure; a regular ice-box
on wheels. How come they pick here for fishing?
Nobody&rsquo;s taken a bass out of Horseshoe in
years, and danged few pickerel. Want that rod
mended?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>A horn blew at the pumps. Jerry put the rod
down and hurried outside, and Dr. Stone walked to
the door. A hoarse voice said: &ldquo;Two quarts of
medium.&rdquo; A moment later the voice rasped
harshly: &ldquo;Get away from that hood. Can&rsquo;t you see
I&rsquo;ve brought a can for the oil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, brother,&rdquo; Jerry soothed. &ldquo;No harm
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away from the hood, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car rolled away, and filled the night with the
low, smooth thunder of its exhaust. The doctor&rsquo;s
ears registered and catalogued sounds. Only a high-priced
motor could sound like that&mdash;and only a
piece of tin could rattle as the car rattled. A queer
intentness twitched at the corners of the blind man&rsquo;s
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; Jerry observed. &ldquo;Two cars in a
row, and they both had something hidden. This
last boiler was all of seven-eight years old, and
shabby as a beggar&rsquo;s coat. Had something under
that hood, though, he was powerful anxious for no
one to see. What do you make of it, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Coincidence,&rdquo; the doctor said mildly. Two
cars, and each with something hidden. Lady&rsquo;s tail
thumped the floor, and Joe Morrow came into the
office and stood around. The doctor&rsquo;s ears, registering
an unseen world by sound, caught the tempo
of the boy&rsquo;s restless feet. Bursting with something,
the blind man decided. The rod mended at last,
man and boy and dog came out to the street, and
Lady led them toward the lake.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s voice trembled. &ldquo;A car pulled out just as
I came back, Uncle David. You know that cobbled
road that runs off from Main street, and goes down
into the hollow behind the cottonwoods and rises
to the back door of the bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road the express wagon uses when it takes
money to and from the bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; The boy swallowed with a gulp. &ldquo;I
saw that car in there twice today, just sort of hanging
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An automobile, making speed, went up the street
with a low drone of power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she goes now,&rdquo; Joe cried, excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful motor,&rdquo; said Dr. Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, Uncle David. A shabby old car
with a pip of a motor. What for? A quick getaway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>The doctor whistled softly under his breath, and
said nothing. Through the black, moonless night
Lady led them at her fast pace to an opening in the
reeds and out upon planking that led to the boats.
Joe got in first, steadied the craft, and helped in his
uncle. The boy rowed with an almost soundless
stroke, and presently shipped the oars and dropped
anchor. And then they waited for the catfish to
bite.</p>
<p>Joe marked Main street by a reflected ribbon of
radiance thrown against the night sky. Water
lapped against the boat, and moving lights crawled
across the distant toll-bridge. Dr. Stone said, &ldquo;Not
much action, Joe,&rdquo; and the headlights of a car swept
toward the lake. They stopped near the planking
and snapped out. By and by oars creaked and
splashed loudly, a dark shape moved toward the
toll-bridge, and voices came across the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the toll-bridge, Rog?&rdquo; the sharp voice
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your head,&rdquo; the genial voice answered.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of light down there. Somebody
may see us trying to haul in a big one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of the time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We got the word, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast work,&rdquo; the sharp voice said dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; A genial chuckle came across
the water. &ldquo;Everybody knows you couldn&rsquo;t get a
decent fish out of this lake with a dragnet. So we
pull out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The oars splashed and creaked, and the sharp
voice was lost. And then the genial voice came
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pull out about five, roll up and get in line,
step on the gas, and make Baltimore in time for
breakfast. After that, let John try to find us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe got a bite and missed his fish. So these two
men, whoever they were, planned to play hide and
seek with somebody named John. But his mind,
presently, came back to the shabby car with the
powerful motor that had hidden itself twice in the
cobbled road behind the cottonwoods where it
could not be seen from Main street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think that car was doing there,
Uncle David?&rdquo; the boy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I knew,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said dryly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be able to
give more attention to this fishing-line.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>A tingling tremor ran along the boy&rsquo;s spine. So
Uncle David thought that strange car worth worrying
about! Lady moved in the boat, and the flat-bottomed
craft pitched and wobbled. The fish
weren&rsquo;t biting, and the dog was probably cramped.
The boy pulled up the anchor. A steady, rhythmic
splashing came through the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re rowing back,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s oars made scarcely a ripple. Tied up at the
planking, he shipped the oars before helping his
uncle from the boat. &ldquo;No fish and a million mosquito
bites,&rdquo; the doctor drawled, and they went up
the soggy path through the reeds. Oars rattled behind
them and somebody stamped on the planking.
A car was parked in the high grass above the rutted
road that paralleled the lake; even in the darkness
there was a lustrous sheen of paint and of shining
metal. One of Lady&rsquo;s harness straps had loosened.
The doctor bent down to draw it tight, and
footsteps came up the planking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rog!&rdquo; The sharp voice snapped. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
somebody at the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; The genial voice was all at once
icy and deadly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve been monkeying&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Joe shivered. Lady, as though recognizing the
threat in that voice, had become stiff and taut. The
boy&rsquo;s hand, feeling for her, met the bristling hairs
along her spine.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone stood up. &ldquo;No threats, if you please,&rdquo;
he said coolly.</p>
<p>Joe marveled that, blind, his uncle could face this
unknown hazard with unruffled calm. But then, of
course, there was Lady. The dog was like a tempered
spring, wound.</p>
<p>The man called Rog flew into a rage. &ldquo;None of
your soft talk. What are you doing at that car?
By God, if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady gave an ominous, warning growl. The
threat stopped as though a gag had been rammed
down the speaker&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the blind man, Rog,&rdquo; the sharp voice said;
&ldquo;the blind man and a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady continued to growl a deep warning. A form
backed away quickly, and the deadly chill went out
of Rog&rsquo;s voice, and he was genial and mellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand apologies, sir. The business of jacking
up a car and stealing the tires has become so
widespread&mdash;&mdash;. You understand, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said blandly, and quieted
the dog. The car backed around and lurched
through the ruts, but not until it was well on its
way were the lights turned on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they look like?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see their faces,&rdquo; the boy answered;
&ldquo;it was too dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What make of car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter.&rdquo; The doctor spoke to Lady and the
dog, sure-footed, led them through the night. Jerry
Moore was closing the garage and Ike Boles, the
station agent, gave them a toothless grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear about the telegram that came this afternoon,
Doctor? Fellow named John&rsquo;s glad to hear
the fishing&rsquo;s good and aims to come up tomorrow
on the 8:11 from New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Memory jingled the wires in Joe&rsquo;s brain. Was
this the same John Rog and his companion were
anxious to avoid?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said mildly, &ldquo;is evidently
playing a little joke on John. Who was the telegram
for, Ike?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow named Carl Metz. Can&rsquo;t find hide or
hair of him hereabouts. Telegram&rsquo;s lying undelivered
at the station. Anybody hear tell of a Carl
Metz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intent look that Joe knew so well had come
to the corners of the doctor&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;Jerry, remember
the man with the husky voice who
wouldn&rsquo;t let you lift the hood? He had a faint
accent. What would you call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;German,&rdquo; Jerry said promptly.</p>
<p>And Carl Metz was a German name. A slow
excitement twitched through Joe&rsquo;s nerves, and he
followed his blind uncle and the dog up the quiet
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the man with the husky voice, Uncle
David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiding a shabby car in the cobbled road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Heat throbbed in the boy&rsquo;s pulse. &ldquo;But
if he&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s expecting John, what about
Rog and the other fellow? Why are <i>they</i> running
away from this John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;yet,&rdquo; the doctor said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Until late that night he smoked his pipe and paced
the porch; and Lady, who read the signs of his unrest,
gave the short whine of a worried dog and
watched him narrowly. In the morning, when he
awoke, Joe had already gone to school. Mrs. Morrow
said: &ldquo;Joe seemed frightfully excited about
something, David.&rdquo; Tight lines formed about the
sightless eyes. Bringing the lawn-mower from the
side of the house, he began to cut the grass. The
lawn was a map in his mind&mdash;so many paces to
every walk and shrub. He was running the mower
near the front gate when a droning throb of power
roared up the road and stopped with a squeal of
brakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; said a husky voice, &ldquo;they tell me
there&rsquo;s a bad, little-traveled hill around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seconds passed. &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; the doctor said
slowly. &ldquo;Three miles on there&rsquo;s a fork to the right;
it takes you to Kill Horse Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty steep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s downright wicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any chance,&rdquo; the hoarse voice asked, &ldquo;of running
into other cars out there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; the doctor assured him; and abruptly the
car, rattling loosely, was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>The blind man pushed the mower aside and
walked thoughtfully to the porch. At noon Joe
arrived, breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle David! I took a look into the cobbled
road before school this morning. That car was there
again, hidden behind the cottonwoods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk into town this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something dark and sinister was going on under
cover, and it was time somebody spoke to Police
Captain Tucker and the bank. Lady, as though
sensing a need for speed, led him toward the village
at a pace faster than the pace of a man with sight.
Suddenly heavy, rapid footfalls grew loud and clear.
Somebody was running with mad haste. Somebody&mdash;&mdash;?
The doctor&rsquo;s ears, sharp as only a blind
man&rsquo;s are sharp, picked a familiar rhythm from the
furious stride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe! Why aren&rsquo;t you at school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy panted. &ldquo;Wanted&mdash;to tell you&mdash;the
bank&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Breath failed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbed?&rdquo; Dr. Stone demanded sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;express wagon. Had money&mdash;for the
bank&mdash;that came in&mdash;on No. 5.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cobbled road?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s breath was easier. &ldquo;In that
hollow behind the cottonwoods that you can&rsquo;t see
from Main street. Captain Tucker was in the wagon
with the driver. When they got into the hollow
there was a man lying in a pool of blood. They
jumped out, and it was only a stuffed figure, and the
blood was red paint. Somebody they couldn&rsquo;t see
said to put up their hands, and Captain Tucker
started to spin around and a shot knocked off his
cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that he kept his hands up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Next thing a bag was over his head
and one over the driver&rsquo;s, and they were tied up and
chucked into the truck. By and by somebody
found them and the money was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-two thousand dollars. They&rsquo;re looking
for that shabby car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll have to look far,&rdquo; Dr. Stone
said grimly. &ldquo;Lady, forward.&rdquo; Again the rapid
pace that ate up distance. &ldquo;What time did the
hold-up happen, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty of twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty&mdash;You&rsquo;re positive of that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what everybody says. No. 5 got in at
half-past eleven. Gosh, Uncle David, if we had told
Captain Tucker last night about that car&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would have made any difference,&rdquo;
the doctor said slowly. The blind eyes had
puckered again with a queer expression of baffled
uncertainty. Opposite the garage he spoke to Lady,
and the dog, obedient, led him in toward the pumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mechanic answered. &ldquo;No, Doctor; had to
go up-country with the wrecker to bring down a
busted car. Hear about the hold-up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Any talk about the getaway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody saw a car come up out of that road,
Doctor. Tucker doesn&rsquo;t know. He had a bag over
his head, and the express engine was running, and,
lying on the floor, all he could hear was his own
motor. Looks like whoever planned it, planned it
neat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty-two thousand dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-eight thousand. Everybody had it
twenty-two thousand at first, but it was twenty-eight
thousand. Twenty thousand in paper money,
and eight thousand in silver.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In silver?&rdquo; The doctor stood very still and broke
into an almost soundless whistle. Joe&rsquo;s heart hammered
against his ribs. He knew the sign&mdash;his
uncle&rsquo;s mind, back in its shroud of darkness, had
touched something tangible and significant. Quietly,
after a long minute of thought, the blind man
walked into the office, groped about the desk for
the telephone, and called the railroad station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ike, this is Dr. Stone. Did you find Carl Metz
and deliver the telegram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not. I can&rsquo;t find a man of the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did this man John arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he did he&rsquo;s a ghost. I watched the train for
a look at who it might be was coming to Horseshoe
for good fishing, and not a stranger got off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did his train get in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone&rsquo;s voice snapped into the transmitter.
&ldquo;Is that the train that leaves New York at 8:11?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Ike; &ldquo;No. 5 on the train-sheet,
and the money that was stolen in the baggage car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The receiver went back upon the hook. The
blind man was on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Half-past two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we hurry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The doctor was out the door,
following Lady at an amazingly fast pace. Joe had
to half run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going, Uncle David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the toll-bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horseshoe Lake rippled with golden sun. Sid
Malloy, the bridge-tender, collected toll and Captain
Tucker, grim and dour, with a ghastly black
hole in the top of his cap, inspected the inside of
every car. He frowned at sight of Dr. Stone, the
boy and the dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he said bluntly, &ldquo;this is no place for a
blind man; and as for a boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go inside, Joe,&rdquo; the doctor said mildly. &ldquo;Keep
out of the way. If trouble starts, duck low and hug
the floor. Is your gun handy, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always have my gun,&rdquo; Captain Tucker
growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently I may speak to one of the cars that
stops to pay toll. Never mind questions. Have your
gun out and cover that car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain had had a bad day and was nettled.
&ldquo;Wild west stuff?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want the next bullet to go a little
lower than your cap, would you, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe sucked in a gasping breath. If there was
shooting, what chance would a blind man stand?
The question had a sobering effect, and the police
captain&rsquo;s voice shed some of its bad wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re waiting for a car, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you describe whoever&rsquo;ll be in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Temper flamed suddenly in the harassed man.
&ldquo;Look here, Doctor, if you don&rsquo;t know what car it
is, or what whoever&rsquo;s in it looks like, you&rsquo;d better
leave this business for those&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can see?&rdquo; Doctor Stone asked mildly.
&ldquo;Sometimes the blindest persons have eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A car stopped at the toll-house and, while Sid
Malloy collected the toll, Captain Tucker opened
the doors and inspected the inside. A clock in a
village church tower struck three, and the midafternoon
traffic thickened and converged upon the
bridge. Cars rolled upon the bridge approach, and
stopped, and rolled on again, and the sound was
like the beat of some large machine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Forgotten by Captain Tucker, for there was
much work to be done and the police officer was
busy probing into automobiles, Dr. Stone and Lady
stood just outside the toll-house door. The smoke
of a seasoned pipe drifted blue and fragrant with
the breeze. Joe, trembling inside the toll-house,
could see his uncle&rsquo;s face. It was stamped with
the calm, bland, inscrutable patience of the blind.</p>
<p>Automobiles shuttled past, and there was a delay
as each car was scrutinized. A line formed, and
horns began to honk impatiently. Joe, twisting his
head to see how far back the line extended, was
frozen by the cold crack of his uncle&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready for you, Tucker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy wrenched himself around. The movement
had changed his position; the sun, slanting in
through the doorway, was in his eyes. The blurred
outline of a car was in front of the house, and he
was conscious of his uncle moving toward the car.
Fire burned in his throat, and the world hung in a
stark silence. And out of that silence came his
uncle&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rog,&rdquo; Dr. Stone drawled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re
going to miss your breakfast in Baltimore tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an oath and a movement in the car.
Joe, frozen, forgot to crouch and hug the floor.
When would the shooting start? And then another
form was beside his uncle, and the sun glinted
menacingly on cold, blue steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your hands up where I can see them,&rdquo;
Captain Tucker ordered.</p>
<p>Joe, sick with relief, felt his knees begin to buckle
and bend.</p>
<p>Two hours later he sat in a room in the red-bricked
Town Hall with his uncle and Captain
Tucker. The captain, putting down a telephone,
leaned far back in his chair and gave a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was New York calling,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve picked up John. He worked for the
New York bank that shipped the money. The
bank here has counted the shipment and it&rsquo;s all there
down to the last nickel.&rdquo; His eyes went slowly from
the boy to the dog and to the blind man. &ldquo;Doctor,
I don&rsquo;t know how you did it. We were all looking
for that shabby car&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That car had me fooled for a while,&rdquo; Dr. Stone
admitted. &ldquo;Joe had me convinced it was motored
for a quick getaway. This morning the car stopped
at our place and the driver asked for directions. He
wanted a bad hill, and I sent him to Kill Horse.
When Joe came along with news of the hold-up,
I started here to tell you where that car could be
found; but when I learned that the hold-up took
place at twenty minutes of twelve the shabby car
was washed right out of the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Captain Tucker demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because within a minute or two of 11:40 the
driver of that car was asking me for directions. He
couldn&rsquo;t have been in two places at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why were you sure it was the shabby car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blind man&rsquo;s ears, Captain&mdash;the sound of the
motor and the driver&rsquo;s husky voice. And all at
once I knew why he had surrounded himself with
so much mystery&mdash;afraid to have Jerry Moore look
under the hood, hiding down behind the cottonwoods
when he did lift the hood, anxious to find a
steep hill little used by other cars. The man was,
without question, experimenting with a carburetor
of his own design, and afraid somebody would get a
slant at it before he was ready to have it patented.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Captain Tucker pursed his lips and rocked in his
chair. &ldquo;I follow you that far, Doctor, but how did
you pick up Rog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said mildly; &ldquo;he dropped
into my lap. Let&rsquo;s begin at the beginning. I met
Rog and his companion at Jerry&rsquo;s garage, and Jerry
had seen that storage-box under the car. It struck
me as strange that a fisherman should try to keep
fish fresh by placing them under a car and next to
a red-hot exhaust pipe. Later, while Joe and I
were on the lake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was last night?&rdquo; the captain interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A boat passed us; I recognized the voices
of Rog and his friend. I learned that they knew
there were few fish in the lake. Now, why had
these men come prepared to pack fish in ice if they
knew there were no fish? I found they planned to
leave today&mdash;roll into line about three o&rsquo;clock, they
said&mdash;and that they wanted to avoid somebody
named John. Coming ashore, Ike Boles told us
of a telegram that had come from John. Now, if
this was their John, why should they tell him the
fishing was good if they knew it wasn&rsquo;t? On the
other hand, the telegram was directed to a Carl
Metz, and nobody knew a Carl Metz. Who was
Carl Metz? The driver of the shabby car spoke
with a German accent. Was he Carl Metz? If
so, why was he never seen fishing? The thing was
rather complicated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see yet how you figured it out,&rdquo; Captain
Tucker complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dr. Stone chuckled. &ldquo;It burst upon
me. After the elimination of the shabby car, Rog
lingered in my mind. I stopped at Jerry&rsquo;s garage;
talking to Jerry might bring forth some overlooked
fact that might prove illuminating. But Jerry was
not there, and his mechanic dropped a bomb-shell&mdash;there
was eight thousand dollars in silver in the
stolen money. I began to wonder if there might be
two Johns: the John who sent a telegram from New
York, and the John whom Rog mentioned, an entirely
different John&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Captain Tucker broke in suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; John Law. The crook&rsquo;s name for the
police. Why should they run from the police?
Was it this hold-up? Eight thousand dollars in
silver is something you cannot hide in your vest
pocket or under your hat. They wouldn&rsquo;t ride with
it thrown into a car; a police drag-net would probably
be searching cars. That silver would have to
be carried where it would defy search. Where better
than a storage-box hidden away under a car,
particularly if we remember two things: First,
these men had said it was an ice-box for fish.
Second, they knew they weren&rsquo;t going to get any
fish. It held together except for one weak link.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had they received word from New York that
this money was coming? That stuffed figure lying
in the cobbled road meant just one thing&mdash;the highwaymen
not only knew that money was coming
but they knew it was coming on No. 5. In order to
know that they must have received a message. That
telegram came into the puzzle again. I called Ike
Boles. He had not found Carl Metz; he had watched
the train that should have brought John and no
stranger had got off. John had said he would leave
New York on the 8:11. The 8:11 was No. 5.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker scratched a puzzled head. &ldquo;But
if nobody got that message&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, let&rsquo;s suppose they know whatever message
was sent would be filed in New York at a certain
time. What better safeguard than to send it to
a name unknown here? What&rsquo;s to prevent the one
to whom that message is really intended loitering
about the station and listening for it to click into
the office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re assuming they know telegraphy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t assuming, captain; I knew. Last night,
when I walked into Jerry&rsquo;s while he was looking
over that storage-box, fingers began to tap a window.
It was a message. It said: &lsquo;Too much attention;
let&rsquo;s scram.&rsquo; I knew those men could read
Morse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker stood up. &ldquo;Doctor, any time
you&rsquo;d like a job as a detective&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off
short. &ldquo;What made you so sure they wouldn&rsquo;t make
their getaway up-country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard Rog say they&rsquo;d roll into line. There&rsquo;s
only one spot in this village where a car has to roll
into line. That&rsquo;s at the toll-bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Out in the village street Dr. Stone filled his pipe
and puffed contentedly. Rog&rsquo;s car stood in the
police driveway beside the Town Hall; and the steel
storage-box, wrenched loose by crowbar and hammer,
lay upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took a chance, Uncle David,&rdquo; Joe said
hoarsely. &ldquo;If that car had slipped past&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rog threatened us on the lake path last night,&rdquo;
the blind doctor said mildly. &ldquo;If I had released the
harness-grip Lady would have torn him down. I
knew only two persons in town who had met the
car, or Rog: Jerry, and he was up-country. You;
but it was dark last night and you wouldn&rsquo;t have
recognized the car. That put it up to Lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe blinked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you owned a dog,&rdquo; Dr. Stone went on, &ldquo;it
would be your dog. I&rsquo;m blind. Lady knows it.
Lady believes she owns me, and she never forgets.
To her Rog will always mean danger&mdash;to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Light broke upon the boy. &ldquo;Then
Lady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. Stone. &ldquo;I knew when Rog&rsquo;s car
stopped at the toll-house. Lady growled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<h2 id="c4">THE UNKNOWN FOUR</h2>
<p>Dr. David Stone, walking rapidly beside Lady,
seemed unaware of the penetrating chill
of the pale, thin dawn. His broad shoulders
swung with his stride, his coat was open, and no
hat covered the white hair of his magnificently-formed
head. But Joe Morrow, his nephew, huddled
down into a turtle-neck sweater and shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Dr. Stone, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have let you
come along on this. You&rsquo;ve never seen a dead man
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chill shook the boy&rsquo;s teeth. &ldquo;A dead man can&rsquo;t
hurt anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; but this may be nasty business. Captain
Tucker says old Anthony was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy sucked in his breath and was
momentarily sorry the telephone that had called his uncle
had awakened him. Crows, cawing faintly, loomed
against the early light of the cold sky. The grass
was wet, and saturated the bottoms of his trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they don&rsquo;t know who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble, Joe. So many persons might
have wanted to.&rdquo; Since turning into Meadow Road
the doctor had been counting paces, and now his
voice changed abruptly. &ldquo;We should be near
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right ahead, Uncle David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone said, &ldquo;Lady, left,&rdquo; and the great, tawny
dog turned obediently. They went up a weed-bordered
path to a house that had once been noble,
but which now lay in peeled-paint neglect.</p>
<p>Captain Tucker let them in. Four men sat in a
room off the hall, and they watched the doorway
in silence as Dr. Stone and the dog appeared. Joe,
crowding at his uncle&rsquo;s heels, was conscious of a
studied ease and a cautious wariness in all of them.
He identified them as Police Captain Tucker made
them known to the blind man&mdash;Ted Lawton,
marked by a certain furtiveness; Ran Freeman, cool
and self-contained; Fred Waring, silently grim, and
Otis King, dapper and assured. Lady, restless on her
leash, suddenly gave an eerie, dismal whine.</p>
<p>Waring flared. &ldquo;Stop that confounded dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said quietly, &ldquo;that there
has been death here&mdash;by violence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Ice ran in Joe&rsquo;s veins. Otis King lit a cigarette
and calmly meditated the glowing end. The doctor
said, &ldquo;Lady, chair,&rdquo; and the dog led him to a seat.
Freeman, sitting on a stool in front of a piano,
dropped one arm and the elbow awoke a crashing,
jangling chord.</p>
<p>Lawton jumped. &ldquo;Did you have to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better take something for your nerves,&rdquo; Freeman
said mildly, and ran one hand soundlessly over
the keys of the piano.</p>
<p>Captain Tucker&rsquo;s voice bit into the silence. &ldquo;One
of you four has every right to be nervous.&rdquo; He
turned to Dr. Stone. &ldquo;I sent for you, Doctor,
because I am baffled. All four of these men came
here late yesterday. Cagge says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Cagge?&rdquo; the doctor broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Anthony Fitch&rsquo;s servant. He says all four
quarreled violently with Anthony last night, and
that the old man cackled at them, and goaded them,
and invited them to remain so that today the comedy
could be resumed. About eleven o&rsquo;clock he went
off to bed, holding to Cagge&rsquo;s arm, after telling the
servant to show the visitors to rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; the doctor asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cagge says he awoke about three o&rsquo;clock this
morning and heard groans. He went to Anthony&rsquo;s
room, and there he found the old man crumpled
on his bed. He had been struck on the temple by
a heavy brass candlestick that lay on the floor. Cagge
says he tried to speak, and muttered one word several
times before he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That word was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four. Over and over again. &lsquo;Four, four, four.&rsquo;
What do you make of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly Doctor Stone filled a pipe, struck a match,
and puffed in unhurried contemplation. &ldquo;It may
be, Tucker, he meant that all four were concerned
in his murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otis King laughed. &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he said easily,
&ldquo;that shot misses the target. There isn&rsquo;t one of us
trusts any of the other three. You couldn&rsquo;t get us
into a combine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know each other,&rdquo; the doctor observed.</p>
<p>Fred Waring jumped angrily to his feet. &ldquo;Look
here, Doctor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady growled deep in her throat, and Waring
slumped into a chair and watched the dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said slowly, &ldquo;if all of you are
not concerned, one man&rsquo;s hand is stained with
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeman still continued to run his hand soundlessly
across the keys. Lawton gave the doctor a
quick, sidelong glance, and stared down at the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; King asked coolly; and now, for
the first time Joe noticed that he alone, of the four
in the room, was fully dressed.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone&rsquo;s hand touched the dog&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I may
tell you&mdash;later. First, I should like to know how all
of you happened to arrive here yesterday. Did the
old man invite you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Otis King drawled; &ldquo;but I rather fancy he
expected us. Did you know he was writing a book?
It was to be one of those brutally frank things&mdash;fire
the gun and let the shots hit whom they may.
Anthony dropped each of us a letter. We were to be
in the book. So, knowing Anthony, we all raced for
the Grand Central and met on the same train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And killed him,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one did,&rdquo; King admitted blandly. &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;m not denying that any of the four of us had reason
to do the job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Fred Waring spoke bitterly. &ldquo;You always did
talk too much, Otis.&rdquo; He lapsed into silence, and
presently spoke to the doctor. &ldquo;If you knew
Anthony Fitch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do,&rdquo; the doctor said mildly. &ldquo;For
several years he was mixed up in shady transactions,
but managed to stay just inside the law. Slippery,
and clever, and unscrupulous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Anthony on the outside,&rdquo; Waring said
passionately. &ldquo;Inside he was vindictive, and cold,
and merciless. Those claw-like hands of his were
the talons of a hawk. He took a pleasure in refined
torture. Years ago we were all tied up with him,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go into that,&rdquo; Ted Lawton
cried warningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to. Anyway, we broke away, and
one of his schemes failed. He told us then that some
day he&rsquo;d pay the score. Lately he set out to write
a book. It was to be called &lsquo;Confessions of a Rascal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s face was expressionless.
&ldquo;Naturally, you gentlemen objected to being included
in the book.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Waring ripped out an oath. &ldquo;He had gone back
fifteen years to rake open old sores. God, man, do
you know what that meant? We thought we had
lived down those old mistakes. We had established
ourselves. I am cashier at a manufacturing plant.
King is manager of a branch brokerage house. Lawton
is in business for himself. Ran Freeman is engaged
to marry Lilly Panner&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone sat up straight. &ldquo;The Calico Heiress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeman&rsquo;s fingers still played imaginary music.
&ldquo;Exactly, Doctor,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;The newspapers
have made the family fairly well known.
Fine old traditions&mdash;that sort of thing. Let this book
of Anthony&rsquo;s appear and my marriage to Miss Panner
would be overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with it the Panner fortune,&rdquo; the doctor observed
dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, too,&rdquo; Ran Freeman admitted without
emotion.</p>
<p>The pipe had gone out. The blind man ran the
bowl absently along one sleeve. Dishes clattered in
the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; the doctor said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve given yourself
sufficient motive for murder, Freeman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We all have sufficient motive,&rdquo; Freeman said
frankly. &ldquo;How long could Waring remain a cashier
if his past were dug out? How long would King
be manager of a brokerage house? How long would
Lawton have enough credit left to stay on in his
business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room fell into silence, and Joe felt sweat on
the palms of his hands. These men discussed murder
as other men might have talked of the loss of a button
from a coat. Dr. Stone put the pipe away and
turned his sightless eyes toward the spot from which
Waring&rsquo;s voice had sounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say Anthony wrote you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us. A devilish letter telling what was
going into the book concerning us. Do you get
that? Paying off, after all these years, the old score;
ramming in the knife and turning it around. Giving
us the prospect of months of anticipation and worry
waiting for the book to appear. So we came up
here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And threatened him?&rdquo; the doctor asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Waring answered after a momentary hesitation.
&ldquo;He laughed at us. He said the only way
to stop that book was to kill him, and invited us to
do it. He said there was a blind man in the village
with the very devil of a dog and that the man who
killed him would be tracked down.&rdquo; Waring&rsquo;s
voice rose. &ldquo;But, for once, Anthony was wrong.
He forgot&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The passionate flow of words
stopped with startling suddenness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he forget?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked.</p>
<p>Waring said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he forget that there was such a thing as the
manuscript being stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker spoke. &ldquo;What good would that
do? The old man could write it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he?&rdquo; Dr. Stone mused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure.
A man who has to lean on a servant&rsquo;s arm is a sick
man&mdash;perhaps a dying man. By the way, Tucker,
did you look for the manuscript?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He kept it in his bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waring,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said slowly, &ldquo;you checked
yourself too late. So Anthony forgot&mdash;and the
manuscript <i>is</i> stolen. That unfinished sentence
could convict you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; Waring snapped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of murder. The man who stole that manuscript
killed Anthony Fitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady whimpered uneasily, and, in the hard
silence, the sound was like the wail of a ghost. Joe&rsquo;s
temples throbbed, and he was conscious of Lawton
watching his uncle in a sort of bleak dread. Slowly
he came to the realization that the blind man, sitting
there in a handicap of darkness was the dominating
figure in the room.</p>
<p>Softly, almost soundlessly, a man wearing an
apron appeared from the kitchen. This, the boy
guessed, was Cagge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made coffee,&rdquo; the servant announced in a
nasal monotone. &ldquo;Anybody want some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeman&rsquo;s hand came away from the piano.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the bacon and eggs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawton gave a grunt of distaste. &ldquo;Ugh! Who
could eat food now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Anthony&rsquo;s death supposed to fill any of us
with sorrow?&rdquo; Freeman asked blandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fry mine on both sides,&rdquo; said Otis King. He
stretched his legs and smoothed his trousers. &ldquo;Cagge,
you were with Anthony how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Any trouble collecting your wages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe saw the servant&rsquo;s face flame. &ldquo;Trouble?
Why, the tight-fisted, old skin-flint&mdash;&mdash;. Do you
know how much he&rsquo;s paid me this last year? A
couple of dollars here and there when I could wring
it out of him. And now he&rsquo;s dead, and where am I
going to collect the four hundred dollars he owes
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say four hundred dollars, Cagge?&rdquo;
King asked softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said four hundred dollars and I mean four
hundred dollars.&rdquo; Like a shadow, almost without
sound, the man was gone. The clatter of a pan
came from the kitchen.</p>
<p>Otis King tapped a cigarette against a silver case.
Joe&rsquo;s hands had gone dry. Somewhere in the house
a clock struck seven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four!&rdquo; King said thoughtfully. &ldquo;What would
you call that, Doctor, coincidence or&mdash;something
else? Many a man has killed for less than four
hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Dr. Stone stood up. Holding to the harness-handle
of the dog&rsquo;s leash he spoke to the four men
who watched him intently. &ldquo;Would a murderer
first tell that his victim kept muttering &lsquo;Four, four,&rsquo;
and then add that the slain man owed him four hundred
dollars? Lady, upstairs.&rdquo; The shepherd dog
guided him across the room skillfully preventing
him from bumping into chairs and furniture. With
his feet on the first tread he spoke again. &ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t Cagge, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you always leap at conclusions?&rdquo; Otis King
asked insolently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I usually keep off paths other men mark for me,&rdquo;
the doctor said quietly.</p>
<p>Joe followed his uncle up the staircase. He kept
close to the dog, afraid, in this house of terror, of he
knew not what. In the upper hall Captain Tucker
halted and clutched his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he said rapidly, &ldquo;there was something
I did not want to tell you downstairs in front of
them. I found something in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finger prints?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; the candle-stick had been wiped clean. A
plain, silk handkerchief. It had evidently been used
to cover the lower part of the murderer&rsquo;s face. I
found it in the center of the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Joe saw the familiar tense lines form around his
uncle&rsquo;s mouth, and a soundless whistle came from
the blind man&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;So! I hadn&rsquo;t expected that.
King was right. They had reason not to trust one
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Captain; nothing. Lead me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A huddled figure was twisted grotesquely upon
the bed. Joe, with a sudden spot of ice in the pit
of his stomach, backed out into the hall. Presently
there were leisurely footsteps on the stairs, and from
inside the room his uncle&rsquo;s voice said, &ldquo;Lady, trail.&rdquo;
The footsteps came on. But the boy&rsquo;s ears were
held by the softer pad-pad-pad of the shepherd
dog&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Lady came out into the hall, ears back and nose
close to the floor. Sniffing, she veered this way and
that, but went steadily along the passage. And then,
suddenly, Joe&rsquo;s heart gave a choked throb, for the
tawny shepherd had swung in and came to a stop
before a closed door. True to her training, she
stopped with her head below the lock; and Dr.
Stone, reaching out a groping hand, touched the
knob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s room is this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; came Otis King&rsquo;s voice from down the
hall.</p>
<p>The tense lines were back around the doctor&rsquo;s
mouth. &ldquo;The trail clouds again, Tucker,&rdquo; he said;
but Captain Tucker, triumphant, held out the silk
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see this before, King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was found near Anthony&rsquo;s body. The dog,
taking a scent from it, followed a trail to your door.
How you explain that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing that this is the first time I&rsquo;ve been upstairs,
I can&rsquo;t explain it. Cagge brought my bag to
this room, but I did not follow. When Anthony
went tottering off to bed I went outdoors and
tramped the roads for hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Captain Tucker barked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was trying,&rdquo; King said, &ldquo;to hatch a plan by
which I might get my hands on that manuscript.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you came back, and came up here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came back, but did not come upstairs. I went
out again at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still plotting, I suppose?&rdquo; Captain Tucker said
in sarcasm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; King said coolly; &ldquo;the second time I acted.
I destroyed Anthony&rsquo;s book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe found it hard to swallow. Uncle David said
the man who stole the manuscript was the man who
had killed! Dr. Stone&rsquo;s face was expressionless:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; King burst out angrily. &ldquo;I told you
I went out. When I came back the house was dark.
As I opened the front door I heard someone run up
the stairs. I snapped on the light, and a bundle of
typed papers lay on the floor. I had to read only
half a page to know it was Anthony&rsquo;s manuscript.
Would I be apt to tell voluntarily that I destroyed
the book if the fact would link me to the murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker seemed a bit taken back. Lawton&rsquo;s
voice came from downstairs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breakfast, Otis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have built this up,&rdquo; Captain Tucker
said suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might,&rdquo; King agreed. He was once more
dapper and assured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>But when he came down stairs to the table, Joe saw
that he had hardened into cold watchfulness. Freeman
said, &ldquo;Sorry you won&rsquo;t eat with us, Doctor.&rdquo;
Lady, walking restlessly around the table, stopped
at Freeman&rsquo;s place and the man offered her a strip
of bacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a dog, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; Dr. Stone agreed; and Joe, reading
something in the word, gave his uncle a sharp, expectant
glance.</p>
<p>Cagge came in from the kitchen with more coffee.
His hand shook as he refilled the cups, and the
spout of the pot chattered against the china.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cagge,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said suddenly, &ldquo;how did you
sleep last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;much,&rdquo; Cagge answered in his nasal
monotone. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like the look of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear anybody go out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The servant put down the pot. &ldquo;It was
blasted queer. I heard somebody go out twice, and
I heard somebody come back three times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make sense,&rdquo; Captain Tucker said
irritably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything makes sense when you understand
it,&rdquo; the blind man observed. Joe, catching a movement
of the hand that held Lady&rsquo;s leash, followed
his uncle into the living-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, was the window of King&rsquo;s room open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meal was over, and the four men came back
through the doorway. Dr. Stone found his chair.
Ran Freeman dropped down upon the piano stool,
but Lawton seemed to seek a seat far from the blind
man and the dog. Waring paced the room, and
Otis King was still cold and watchful.</p>
<p>Freeman&rsquo;s fingers, once more running soundlessly
over the keys, struck a faint note. As though the
sound had broken a barrier, he banged a chord.
The next instant, swinging about on the stool, he
faced the instrument and began to play, freely and
without restraint.</p>
<p>Joe found it hard to swallow. Music, in this house
of death, sounded ghastly, almost sacrilegious. He
looked at his uncle. The calmness was gone from
Dr. Stone&rsquo;s face. Around the sightless eyes, around
the serene mouth, strange, intense lines he knew
well had suddenly formed.</p>
<p>Captain Tucker had gone out into the kitchen
to talk to Cagge. Freeman ended with a crash of
sound. Seconds passed, and nobody spoke. The
silence seemed no more ghastly than the music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ran,&rdquo; Otis King drawled, dangerously quiet,
&ldquo;your veins must be filled with ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why be hypocrites?&rdquo; Freeman demanded.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not mourning Anthony, are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can be decent about it,&rdquo; King told him.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone&rsquo;s voice was again a calm stream. &ldquo;There
was one part, Freeman&mdash;Tum, te-tum-tum, tum-tum-te-tum.
Toward the end. The execution was
fast. Tum, te-tum&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this.&rdquo; Freeman faced the key-board again
and began to play. &ldquo;This what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play it,&rdquo; said the blind man.</p>
<p>Ran Freeman played. He was an artist, and he
knew it. But Joe no longer gave ear to the music.
Something quiet&mdash;something too quiet&mdash;had been in
his uncle&rsquo;s voice. Something that suggested a cocked
trigger about to be fired. He shivered, and gripped
the ends of his sweater, and held them tight.</p>
<p>For the second time the music ended in a crash
of chords. Freeman, swung about on the stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautifully done,&rdquo; the blind man said. He lay
back against the cushions of the chair, loose and relaxed.
&ldquo;In fact, it would have been perfect if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Freeman chuckled. &ldquo;Are you a music critic, too,
Doctor? If what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said quietly, &ldquo;if many of those
rapid notes had been struck by a living touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe screamed, &ldquo;Look out, Uncle David.&rdquo; For
Freeman, no longer self-contained, had leaped
from the stool and one hand had gone toward a
pocket.</p>
<p>The blind man did not move. &ldquo;Lady, get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tawny form hurtled through the air. There
was the sound of a falling body, a scream of terror.
Captain Tucker came running in from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Tucker.&rdquo; Dr. Stone&rsquo;s voice was
once more a calm stream. &ldquo;Lady will merely hold
him. He&rsquo;s your man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Lawton, King and Waring
were gone, glad to be free and away. Ran Freeman,
white and sullen, sat handcuffed in one of the
big chairs. Captain Tucker, having telephoned for
a policeman to relieve him until the Coroner arrived,
came back to the living-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t get it, Doctor,&rdquo; he said ruefully.
&ldquo;After Lady trailed to King&rsquo;s room&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was a laid trail,&rdquo; Dr. Stone told him.
&ldquo;Anthony had warned them there was a dog that
could track. Would a man deliberately invite detection
by leaving a trail right to his door? However,
some one of the four had been in the room.
Which one? Probably the one with most at stake.
Lawton stood to suffer in a small business. Waring
and King would have lost their jobs. But Freeman
stood to lose the Panner fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;King told us he had not been in the room, or unpacked
his bag, or been to bed. So far as the bed
and the bag were concerned it had to be the truth,
for it was a story too easily disproved if he had
lied. By the same reasoning, knowing that there
was a dog in the neighborhood that could follow
scent, he would not have made a trail to his own
room if he had committed murder. Therefore,
when the trail led to a room in which there was a
rumpled bed and a bag partly unpacked, one fact
was obvious. King was not the man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He said he had gone out twice. But Cagge
said somebody had come in three times. Did you
notice the open window in King&rsquo;s room? The
ceilings down here are low&mdash;a blind man can feel
these things. The second floor wouldn&rsquo;t be far
from the ground. Whoever killed Anthony knew
King was out of the house. Therefore, after the
crime, he purposely left the silk handkerchief to
give the dog a scent. Then, going to King&rsquo;s room,
he mussed the bed, dragged clothing out of the bag,
and dropped out the window. No doubt you&rsquo;ll
find deep footprints where he dropped. Going into
the room and out the window, he probably reasoned,
brought the trail to King&rsquo;s room and ended it
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the third man Cagge heard come in.
He must have brought Anthony&rsquo;s manuscript back
into the house with him intending to dispose of
it later. But King must have come back almost on
his heels. Not wanting to be found with the manuscript
he dropped it and fled. Perhaps he reasoned
that King, finding it, would destroy it, anyway.
If I had any doubts at all they were gone when we
came downstairs. The four men were eating.
Lady, circling the table, stopped at Freeman&rsquo;s
chair. She had found the scent again. I don&rsquo;t
think Freeman meant to kill. His idea was to steal
the book. But Anthony awoke. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Freeman had recovered some of his nerve. &ldquo;Do
you expect any jury to convict on the testimony of
a dog?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tucker,&rdquo; said Dr. Stone, &ldquo;will you look at his
right hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe shrank away from the prisoner&rsquo;s violent
struggle to free himself of the handcuffs. Captain
Tucker, holding Freeman in the chair, turned a
startled face toward the blind man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Doctor?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Tucker. I had the testimony of Lady,
but I needed greater proof. Freeman gave it to me
when he played the piano. All through the music
something kept recurring. Perhaps, were I not
blind, did I not have to depend so much on hearing,
I would not have noticed it. A hesitation on certain
notes, an almost imperceptible break in the rhythm,
a faint click upon the ivory of the keys that could
only be made by something foreign, something that
was not living flesh. Freeman has an artificial
finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeman had slumped in the chair. Captain
Tucker straightened up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he said curiously, &ldquo;your brain travels
too fast for me.... Much too fast. Just what
does that prove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said quietly. &ldquo;Modern
surgery does miracles these days. Freeman has an
artificial finger that can be taken off. Do you remember
Cagge&rsquo;s story? Old Anthony kept muttering
&lsquo;Four, four.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what he had seen. Four!
Four fingers on the hand of his murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c5">BLIND MAN&rsquo;S TOUCH</h2>
<p>Dr. Stone, reaching into the closet, found
the gray suit that needed pressing. He knew
it was gray because his fingers felt the three
sharply-ridged lines of thread sewed on the inside of
the collar. So, to the blind man, was every suit,
shirt, tie and sock in his wardrobe marked for exact
identification. One raised ridge of thread for blue,
two for brown, and three for gray.</p>
<p>He came down the stairs with the suit. Joe Morrow
had put a leash on Lady, and she whined
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready to go, old girl?&rdquo; The blind man patted
the dog&rsquo;s head and took the leash. &ldquo;All set, Joe?
Got your money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; The boy felt for the two dollars he
had earned weeding a neighbor&rsquo;s garden. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
fourteen dollars saved,&rdquo; he boasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wealth,&rdquo; the doctor chuckled, and snapped
open his watch and touched the exposed hands with
a finger. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back in time for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>But that was a dinner they were destined never
to eat.</p>
<p>Roses bloomed in the summer heat, fields of corn
tasseled in the sun, and a dog ran out of a yard and
barked at them furiously. Lady, intent only on the
blind man in her keeping, pricked up her ears but
did not change her rapid pace. The village was
busy with its Saturday morning trade, and the
tawny brute carefully maneuvered the doctor
through the crowds. Joe clutched his two dollars
and his bank-book. They left the gray suit at the
tailor&rsquo;s and came out to the street. And at that moment
a man, coatless and hatless, ran out of the
Pelle Canning Company building and went past
them, panting.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone said: &ldquo;Did you hear that man&rsquo;s breathing,
Joe? He&rsquo;s frightened. Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pelle,&rdquo; the boy told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>The doctor said: &ldquo;Lady, right,&rdquo; and followed
the dog across the roadway to the bank side of the
street. A small door in one of the two-story brick
buildings opened suddenly, and a girl hurried out.
The door was marked: &ldquo;<span class="small">OFFICE, MIDSTATE TEL.
CO. UPSTAIRS</span>,&rdquo; and the girl was Tessie Rich, one
of the telephone operators. In her haste she almost
ran into the blind man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m sorry, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm done, Tessie,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said, and
chuckled slyly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our way to the bank.
Any message you&rsquo;d like me to give Albert Wall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl colored rosily. &ldquo;I usually give him my
own messages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wail of a siren filled the street and a police
car went past them, traveling fast. Instantly the
girl was across the sidewalk and through the telephone
company door. The car stopped at the
bank, and Joe saw a figure in blue uniform and
brass buttons get out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Tucker?&rdquo; the blind man asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Uncle David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tessie gone? I see. And Tucker and Pelle
both in a hurry.&rdquo; The doctor whistled an almost
soundless whistle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get on, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Something had gone wrong at the bank. The
boy saw that at once. A score of depositors clung
together in knots on the main floor, uneasy bank
clerks stood behind the bronze grille of the teller&rsquo;s
windows, and from some inner room came a roaring,
bull voice shouting in anger. Bryan Smith, the
president of the bank, agitated and flushed, appeared
in the doorway of the little room, saw the
blind man and cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor! Doctor Stone! This way, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Morrow, still clutching his two dollars and
his pass-book, went with his uncle and the dog, and
the door closed upon them. Inside the room three
men stood about the bank president&rsquo;s desk. The
veins in Mr. Pelle&rsquo;s neck were swollen with rage;
Albert Wall, the cashier, tapped his fingers against
the desk and frowned, and a third man, who looked
lost and bewildered, held on to the back of a chair
near the window. This third man, whom Joe had
never seen before, smelled of antiseptics and carried
his right arm in a sling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; Bryan Smith sputtered, &ldquo;this bank has
been robbed of five thousand dollars. Robbed right
under our noses. Not fifteen minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; the doctor asked quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. Somebody put a forged check
through the window. At least Pelle says he signed
only one check and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean I say I signed only one
check?&rdquo; the canner roared. &ldquo;I tell you I signed
only one. I should know! If you were fools enough
to pay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I telephoned you, Mr. Pelle,&rdquo; Albert Wall
broke in. &ldquo;You said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I said. I told you I had given a
check to Fred Hesset for five thousand dollars. If
you paid five thousand dollars to another man on a
forged check that&rsquo;s your funeral. The real Hesset
is here.&rdquo; Mr. Pelle pointed to the man with bandaged
arm. &ldquo;Pay him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; Bryan Smith fumed. &ldquo;One check
has been paid already. Now we have another and
you say you signed only one. Which one?&rdquo; The
bank president held out two slips of paper.</p>
<p>Joe had a glimpse of them. Both were dated that
day, both were made out to Fred Hesset, both were
for five thousand dollars, both were signed &ldquo;Paul
Pelle.&rdquo; The canner stared at them for a long minute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This one,&rdquo; he said, and pushed one of the checks
across the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because this one is number 1046. I gave Hesset
check No. 1046.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about your signature on this other check?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you that isn&rsquo;t my signature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a quick movement the banker scrambled
the checks and then laid them side by side partly
covered by a blotter so that only the signatures
showed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Pelle,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;which one did you
sign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The canner&rsquo;s neck swelled again. &ldquo;What is
this,&rdquo; he roared; &ldquo;a trap? I can&rsquo;t tell them apart.
That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re supposed to be able to do. I
tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen.&rdquo; Dr. Stone&rsquo;s voice was mild.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay with facts. As I understand it Pelle
gave a man named Hesset a check for five thousand
dollars this morning. What for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Damages,&rdquo; Mr. Pelle snapped. &ldquo;Hesset owns a
butcher shop at Arlington. One of my trucks got
out of control and skidded into the front of the
shop. Hesset was caught in the wreckage; broken
arm and broken collarbone. I don&rsquo;t carry liability
insurance. I settled with him and gave him a check
at eleven o&rsquo;clock this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker said: &ldquo;Where does this second
check come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them, Albert,&rdquo; Bryan Smith ordered.</p>
<p>The cashier&rsquo;s fingers ceased to tap the desk. &ldquo;At
11:13&mdash;I happened to glance at the clock&mdash;a man
pushed a check through the window. It was a five
thousand dollar check, made out to Fred Hesset and
signed by Mr. Pelle. The man couldn&rsquo;t identify
himself, so I called Mr. Pelle and was told he had
given the check a few minutes before. I cashed it.
Ten minutes later another Hesset check for five
thousand dollars came through the window. It
looked queer. I called Mr. Pelle again.&rdquo; Albert
Wall made a gesture with his hands. &ldquo;Then I telephoned
for Captain Tucker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain cleared his throat. &ldquo;That first check
was the forged check?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the cashier&rsquo;s hands moved. &ldquo;So Mr. Pelle
says.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>The canner&rsquo;s face was livid. But before he could
roar his wrath Dr. Stone&rsquo;s voice sounded quietly in
the breathless tension of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see those checks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; The idea of sightless eyes trying to
examine handwriting staggered Bryan Smith.
&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, of course, Doctor,&rdquo; he said weakly.</p>
<p>The checks crinkled faintly in the blind man&rsquo;s
hands. Joe, watching his uncle&rsquo;s face, suddenly
saw a sign that sent a hot needle through his spine.
Tight, puckered lines had gathered around the
sightless eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many persons knew this check was to be
paid today?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Mr. Pelle answered shortly. &ldquo;Things
not connected directly with the buying and selling
I keep to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you wrote Hesset surely your stenographer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t write. I telephoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last Monday evening&mdash;seven o&rsquo;clock. I was
alone in the office. I told him to be here promptly
at eleven this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Albert Wall said: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me a moment&mdash;&rdquo;
and was gone. Joe felt the warning pressure
of his uncle&rsquo;s foot upon his toe. The door of
the inner room had not been tightly closed. Craning
his neck, the boy saw the cashier at a telephone.
Presently Albert Wall came back still with that
slight frown upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This thing was planned ahead,&rdquo; Captain Tucker
said slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgery is always planned ahead,&rdquo; Dr. Stone
agreed. &ldquo;Somebody knew that at eleven this morning
Pelle was to give Hesset a check. By the way,
Pelle, when you telephoned Monday evening did
you tell Hesset what the amount of the check
would be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. No man settles a damage claim without
knowing what he&rsquo;s going to get. I offered five
thousand dollars; he accepted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So somebody knew three important facts&mdash;that
you were going to pay a check at a certain time,
the exact amount of the check and to whom it was
to be made payable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knew it,&rdquo; the canner insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except you and Hesset,&rdquo; the blind man said
mildly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>The bandaged man, holding to the back of the
chair, seemed to grow even more bewildered. Mr.
Pelle&rsquo;s face was thrust across the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he rasped, &ldquo;are you insinuating&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady gave a low, deep-throated growl. One of
the blind man&rsquo;s hands touched the tawny head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pelle,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how did you come to pick a
Saturday morning to settle with Hesset?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any law against it?&rdquo; Mr. Pelle demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s voice was bland. &ldquo;This is
a small bank. It has only two really busy hours in
the week. There is a rush from eleven to noon on
Saturday just before the week-end closing; another
rush from eight to nine Monday morning with business
men coming in with their Saturday cash.
During the week there would be leisure for a cashier
to scrutinize a man; perhaps to telephone and ask,
among other things, for a description. But on Saturday,
after eleven, there is pressure and haste.
And in this hour of pressure a check went through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pelle wet his lips nervously. Captain Tucker
stood very still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else, Doctor?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo; The blind man took a pipe from
his pocket and filled it slowly. &ldquo;Why did Hesset
bring his check here to be cashed? Why didn&rsquo;t he
take it back to Arlington and deposit it in his own
bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Hesset?&rdquo; the police captain barked.</p>
<p>Joe saw the bandaged man grip the back of the
chair with his good hand. &ldquo;I know nothing about
two checks, Captain. I saw only one check. I
wanted the money in my pocket. Cash is cash.
Sometimes a check you think is good&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pelle&rsquo;s roar filled the room. &ldquo;You dare say
that to me, Hesset?&rdquo; Captain Tucker sprang between
the two men, and Joe shrank out of the way.
Dr. Stone said: &ldquo;I had better take the dog out of
here. Come, Joe.&rdquo; It was long past noon, and the
bank was closed. Albert Wall went with them
down the long, deserted floor to open the front door
and let them out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of this?&rdquo; he asked in an
undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pelle?&rdquo; the doctor asked mildly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>The cashier hesitated. &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes. Five thousand
dollars is a lot of money. I know the condition
of Pelle&rsquo;s account; business hasn&rsquo;t been any too good
of late and five thousand dollars might hit him hard.
If he could pay five thousand dollars with one hand
and manipulate a forged check with the other and
get five thousand dollars back from the bank&mdash;.
For that, though, he&rsquo;d need a confederate, somebody
to go to the window with the first check. It
doesn&rsquo;t seem probable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A possibility though,&rdquo; the blind man said. &ldquo;A
great many possibilities,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not forget
Hesset. Either Hesset or Pelle could have
worked this with a confederate. Or some person,
unknown and unsuspected, might be the criminal.
Good day, Albert.&rdquo; He held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Doctor.&rdquo; Their hands met. The
heavy door of the bank closed.</p>
<p>The puckered lines had come back to the sightless
eyes. Man, boy and dog came down the stone
steps of the old-fashioned building. On the sidewalk
the doctor spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, you could see them. How did Pelle strike
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was wild,&rdquo; the boy answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man may protest too much or too little,&rdquo; the
blind man observed dryly. &ldquo;Hesset?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So! That leaves Albert Wall. Could you see
him when he left the room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good lad!&rdquo; The doctor knocked the ashes
from his pipe and walked beside the dog in silence.
&ldquo;The telephone office,&rdquo; he said suddenly.</p>
<p>Joe wondered what unseen tangent of the case
could bring them there. They went up a narrow
mountain of a stairway. Lady, leading, slowed and
swung her Master to the left, stopping him at the
counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me,&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked, &ldquo;what operators
were on duty at seven o&rsquo;clock last Monday
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have only one girl on duty after 6:45,&rdquo; the
manager told him, and consulted a record. &ldquo;That
was Tessie Rich&rsquo;s night. Any complaint, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Merely a matter of information,&rdquo; the doctor
smiled. Back in the sunlight Joe saw that the smile
was gone and that the puckers around the sightless
eyes had become intent. Dr. Stone said absently:
&ldquo;You must be hungry, Joe,&rdquo; and they went toward
a restaurant. But before they reached it there was
a rush of feet and a woman&rsquo;s breathless voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor!&rdquo; It was Tessie Rich. &ldquo;Why did you
want to know if I was on duty last Monday night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The girl was nonplused. &ldquo;But&mdash;but you
asked&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked who was on duty,&rdquo; the doctor said
gently. &ldquo;Did you have any reason to think I was
asking about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subtle, hidden undertones filled the question, and
the hot needle was again in Joe&rsquo;s spine. The girl
raised a handkerchief to her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, of course not, Doctor? Why
should I?&rdquo; There was something of hysterical
panic in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; the blind man asked, blandly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>In the restaurant Joe Morrow chewed on food
that all at once stuck in his throat. Why had his
uncle gone to the telephone office? What hidden
spring had that visit touched and what had
frightened Tessie Rich? Were Mr. Pelle and the
girl both involved? Had the canner actually signed
two checks? What about Mr. Hesset? Who had
gone to the bank with the first check and walked
out with five thousand dollars in cash?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who did it, Uncle David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pipe came out of a pocket; blue smoke spiraled
fragrantly about a face that had become placid and
bland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, the bank is built on a corner&mdash;at an angle to
the corner. How far up the street can you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as Pelle&rsquo;s factory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know who didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; the blind man said,
and stood up. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added quietly, &ldquo;I think I
know who did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe hoped it wasn&rsquo;t Tessie Rich. They walked
out of the village and up along the dirt road. The
doctor said aloud: &ldquo;If I could pick one more link&mdash;&rdquo;
and left the sentence unfinished and said no more.
Tree toads made metallic clamor in the afternoon
heat, and the earth smelled as though it were baked.</p>
<p>A clock struck three as they entered the house.
Dr. Stone paced the porch and Lady stretched off in
a patch of sun and watched him steadily. Joe
brought up a tool from the cellar and prepared to
trim the hedge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>A light delivery truck stopped in the road and a
young man carried a suit up to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re prompt,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said. The suit was
on a hanger; the coat brushed against his knee with
a soft crinkle. He ran one hand into a pocket and
pulled out a paper. Strange! There had been
nothing in the pockets of the suit he had carried
away. His hand went up quickly to feel inside the
collar. The three sharply ridged lines of thread
were not there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Stop that tailor&rsquo;s boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
But the driver had already discovered his mistake.
He came up the walk with the suit of gray. Joe laid
down the clippers and followed him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry that up to your room, Uncle Da&mdash;&mdash;What&rsquo;s
Lady got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog had found a paper on the floor. Now
she carried it to the doctor. It crinkled in his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>It was a small paper, no larger than half a sheet
from a note-book. Joe watched those hands move,
gently exploring, over every inch of surface. And
as the hands moved, Dr. Stone&rsquo;s face changed. Joe
had seen that sharp, alert expression before. It was
a silent sign that, some place in the eternal darkness
of his world, the blind man had found light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, there is writing on this paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; The boy looked closer and drew in a
hot, throbbing breath. &ldquo;Uncle David! The same
thing&rsquo;s written all over it. Paul Pelle, Paul Pelle,
Paul Pelle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone said a soft: &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and folded the paper
and put it in his pocket. &ldquo;The criminal always
slips,&rdquo; he observed; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s always something forgotten.&rdquo;
He stood for a moment whistling softly.
&ldquo;Care to stretch your legs? I want a word with the
tailor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s eyes, fascinated, were on the writing. That
paper had fallen from the suit delivered by mistake,
and now his uncle wanted to know to whom the
suit belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you telephone him, Uncle David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blind man&rsquo;s mouth twitched. &ldquo;The call
might pass through Tessie&rsquo;s switchboard,&rdquo; he said
dryly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>The boy groped, and stumbled, and sought to
find the meaning. The afternoon sun was low; the
first cool breath of evening breeze blew over the
dirt road. He waited outside while his uncle talked
with the tailor; when the man came out he was
whistling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police station,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Captain Tucker was at his desk. &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he
burst out, &ldquo;this thing is baffling. Lay those two
checks side by side and you can&rsquo;t tell the signatures
apart. I&rsquo;ve talked to New York. There isn&rsquo;t a
forger known to the police in this part of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone asked: &ldquo;Did Albert Wall give you a
description?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the man who cashed that first check? A lot
of good that does. Five feet eight, about 155
pounds, dark, clean-shaven, blue suit. It fits a
million men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would,&rdquo; the doctor said blandly. His face
was inscrutable. &ldquo;You heard Pelle&rsquo;s story and
Albert Wall&rsquo;s. Get statements prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For them to sign.&rdquo; His hands felt along the
desk for the telephone and he called Bryan Smith&rsquo;s
house. &ldquo;Bryan? Dr. Stone. Do you know where
you can find Albert at this hour? He&rsquo;s with you
now? Can you have him at the bank in an hour?
I&rsquo;ll be along with Captain Tucker and Pelle.&rdquo; He
put down the telephone. &ldquo;You have an hour,
Tucker, in which to get those statements ready and
dig up Pelle. He&rsquo;s probably at the factory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why signed statements?&rdquo; Captain Tucker
demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bait,&rdquo; the blind man said casually. &ldquo;Sometimes
you use cheese in a trap; sometimes you use printed
words.&rdquo; He settled into a chair and closed his
eyes, and appeared to doze. The dog, ever watchful,
lay at his feet.</p>
<p>Captain Tucker left the room, and presently, in
another part of the police station, a typewriter began
to click. The captain came back grumbling and
out-of-sorts. The doctor&rsquo;s devious, subtle methods
always provoked him to a show of ill-humor. The
telephone rang sharply&mdash;there had been an automobile
crash near the bridge. A minute later a
motor roared into life in the alley beside the station
and a motorcycle patrolmen sped away. The
blind man did not stir.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Joe Morrow squirmed restlessly and watched the
clock. Mr. Pelle arrived in a chastened, subdued
mood; a uniformed man brought Captain Tucker
several typewritten sheets; the wall clock struck the
hour, and Dr. Stone opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready, Tucker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove to the bank in the police car. Bryan
Smith let them in. Dusk had begun to gather in the
corners farthest from the windows, a guardlight
burned in front of the steel safe, and a burst of ceiling
lights shone from the inner room. Captain
Tucker and Mr. Pelle went on ahead while the bank
president saw to it that the door was securely
locked. The doctor lingered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bryan,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;are there pens and ink
on your desk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove them; Lady, forward.&rdquo; And before the
man could reply the doctor was on his way past the
teller&rsquo;s cages, one hand holding the harness-grip, his
body bent a little toward the guiding dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Bryan Smith, saying that they might need room,
cleared the desk. Mr. Pelle&rsquo;s eyes shifted from side
to side and missed nothing. Albert Wall seemed to
wait patiently the outcome of this strange gathering.
But what held Joe&rsquo;s attention and sent the blood
pounding in his veins was a something that lay behind
the passive placidity of his uncle&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Tucker,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said, &ldquo;has prepared
statements for Pelle and Albert to sign. You have
pens, gentlemen? Now, if you will sign them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Albert Wall read rapidly and, taking a fountain
pen from his pocket, signed at once. Mr. Pelle read
his paper through and then read it again. He wrote
his name slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Albert&rsquo;s paper, Captain.&rdquo; The doctor laid it on
the desk at his right hand. &ldquo;Pelle&rsquo;s.&rdquo; It went upon
the left. &ldquo;Now, Bryan, if I may have those checks.
First the one Pelle says he didn&rsquo;t sign.&rdquo; It went
upon the right with Albert Wall&rsquo;s statement.</p>
<p>The bank president&rsquo;s nerves had been under a
long strain. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this, Doctor?&rdquo;
he snapped. &ldquo;If you have your suspicions, let us
know them. If you have anything to say, say it.
Don&rsquo;t waste time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; the doctor said mildly. His hands
had moved, mysteriously explored, and had come to
rest. That vague something in his face was no
longer there; he was serene. When he spoke again
his voice was almost confidential. &ldquo;Had that fountain
pen long, Albert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cashier was surprised. &ldquo;Four or five years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kept it too long. It tripped you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tripped? Look here, Doctor, what are you
driving at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money,&rdquo; the blind man said. &ldquo;Five thousand
dollars. What did you do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the appalled silence of the room Joe heard
clearly the sound of someone breathing with an
effort. The cashier had not moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;re saying, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; the doctor said pleasantly. From his
pocket he drew out a paper. &ldquo;Did you ever see
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the paper Lady had picked from the floor.
Albert Wall&rsquo;s eyes widened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dangerous business, handling money,&rdquo; Dr.
Stone mused. &ldquo;Thousands upon thousands of dollars
pouring through one&rsquo;s hands every day. Other
people&rsquo;s money. If a man has a weak spot some
place inside it may get him&mdash;a fever to have some of
this money for his own. If the right moment
comes, or the right scheme presents itself&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You heard about the settlement Pelle was to
make with Hesset, didn&rsquo;t you, Albert? The weak
spot took control. You saw a chance to put your
hands on five thousand dollars so cleverly that it
would never be traced to you. You must have
spent hour upon hour practicing Pelle&rsquo;s signature.
And finally you had a check that you thought was
perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could see Pelle&rsquo;s factory. Saturday morning
you saw Hesset go in. You may have gone to
Arlington so you&rsquo;d know what he looked like; you
may have figured you&rsquo;d know him because he
would be bandaged. You saw him come out; you
waited a minute or two. Then you telephoned
Pelle that a man was at the window with a five thousand
dollar check. Naturally Pelle said it was all
right. You knew he&rsquo;d say that. Hadn&rsquo;t he just
given the check? So you stamped &lsquo;paid&rsquo; on the
check you had forged, and placed it with the checks
the bank had cashed that morning. Shortly thereafter
the real Hesset appeared and you telephoned
Pelle again. Oh, it was a sweet scheme, Albert.
Apparently there was no come-back. Hadn&rsquo;t Pelle
told you to pay the first check? Could the bank be
held responsible for paying a check Pelle told it to
pay? In its simplicity the plan was almost genius.
But&mdash;&rdquo; The doctor paused. &ldquo;You slipped.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>The cashier had not moved. &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he said
evenly, &ldquo;your story is preposterous. You heard
Pelle say he was alone in the office when he telephoned
Hesset. To put a scheme like this through
I would have to know in advance that a settlement
had been made, when a check was to be given, and
for how much. How could I know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bryan,&rdquo; the blind man said, &ldquo;will you call the
telephone office and ask them can they send Tessie
Rich over here for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bank president reached for the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Albert Wall called sharply.
In a moment all the self-control had gone out of
him. There was a chair behind him; he reached
back and sank into it heavily. &ldquo;Keep her out of it,&rdquo;
he said in a whisper. &ldquo;I&mdash;I did it. I alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pelle wiped beads of sweat from his forehead.
&ldquo;I thought you suspected me, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is wise, sometimes, to appear to suspect the
innocent. Do you remember I asked for the checks
this morning? A moment later I knew you were
not the man. As soon as you said you had telephoned
Hesset a significant thing happened.
Albert left the room. He went to a telephone. My
guess is he went there to warn Tessie not to tell anybody
she had spoken to him about the Hesset settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cashier lifted a white face. &ldquo;How did you
know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deduction. One person could have heard what
Pelle said to Hesset&mdash;the central operator through
whom the call passed. When I left here Albert
took me to the door. I made a point of shaking
hands with him. A cashier who had just paid a
forged check, it is only natural to suppose, would
be nervous and upset. Albert&rsquo;s hand was hard and
strained, his grip that of a man steeled to see something
through.... What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stopped at the telephone office and asked what
girls had been on duty at seven o&rsquo;clock Monday
evening. Tessie had been on duty alone. I did
not mention her name; and yet, before I had gone
one hundred feet, she was out in the street after me,
badly shaken, demanding to know why I had inquired
about her. That end of the picture was
complete. Tessie and Albert were sweethearts;
she had told him of the Pelle call in confidential
gossip. I knew then who the guilty man was, but
I could not prove it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This afternoon the tailor delivered me another
man&rsquo;s suit by mistake. I found it was Albert&rsquo;s.
This was in one of the pockets.&rdquo; The doctor
pushed across the desk the paper covered with the
canner&rsquo;s signature. &ldquo;Probably every other paper
on which Albert had practiced the signature had
been destroyed&mdash;this one had been overlooked. As
he could not have practiced forgery at the bank he
must have done it at home. And as the same pen
had written the signatures on this paper and the
signature on the forged check, they must have been
written, not with a bank pen, but with a pen that
Albert carried with him. I wanted to have him use
that pen before witnesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I had Captain Tucker prepare statements and
bring you here. I had Bryan clear the desk so that
Albert would have no other pen to use but his own.
Once he signed that statement he had damned himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Bryan Smith, examining the two checks, shook
his head. &ldquo;Doctor, you cannot see. How could
you tell that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a magnifying glass?&rdquo; the blind man
asked.</p>
<p>The bank president took one from a drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Examine the check Pelle signed and the statement
he signed. Both signatures are smooth. Look
at the forged check. There are three l&rsquo;s in Paul
Pelle. On each of the three upstrokes on the l&rsquo;s the
pen gouged the paper a bit. Here&rsquo;s the paper that
was in the suit. The same gouge on the upstrokes.
Now the statement Albert Wall signed. There are
also three l&rsquo;s in his name, and the same gouge on the
upstrokes. All made by the same pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Morrow was filled with a sense of pride and
wonder. Bryan Smith said slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor, I fail to see how you, sightless, could
detect that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eyes,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said. &ldquo;Auxiliary eyes. When
sight goes, other senses quicken.&rdquo; He laid his hands
upon the table, palms up, and the light shone upon
the delicate, sensitive finger tips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you could feel these grooves?&rdquo; Captain
Tucker demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain ran his own fingers across the signatures.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
feel a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone filled his pipe with expert care. &ldquo;You
are not blind,&rdquo; he said mildly. &ldquo;You lack a blind
man&rsquo;s touch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<h2 id="c6">BIRTHDAY WARNING</h2>
<p>Even though his eyes could not tell the difference
between light and darkness, Dr. Stone
knew that day had broken. The air had an
early morning smell. Reaching out, he felt for the
clock from which the glass face had been removed;
his sensitive fingers, touching the exposed hands
lightly, recorded the time. Five minutes of six.
He sat up in bed.</p>
<p>He had gone to sleep thinking of Allan Robb, and
now, awake, the thought returned. Tomorrow
would be Allan&rsquo;s birthday. Twenty-one years old;
the master, in his own right, of a fortune. The doctor
chuckled, and wondered just how much of a
master Allan would really be&mdash;for a while, anyway.
For Alec Landry was Allan&rsquo;s guardian and had
lived at the Robb homestead these six years since
old Jamie Robb&rsquo;s death. A straightforward man,
Alec Landry, who had obeyed old Jamie&rsquo;s dying
command to &ldquo;bring up my boy right.&rdquo; A loud,
hearty man, with a love of having his own way and
a habit of roaring down any who opposed him. Tomorrow,
then, Allan Robb would become master
in name; but it would be several years, probably, before
the young man got out from under Alec Landry&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>A good thing, Dr. Stone thought dryly. Already
there were signs of attentions that might turn the
head of a young man suddenly independent. Tomorrow
there was to be a great party. That was
all right&mdash;a lad comes of age only once. Bruce
Robb had sent up a blooded mare from New York.
That was all right, too&mdash;Bruce was Allan&rsquo;s cousin.
But all yesterday afternoon cars had come in
through the village, traveling fast. Cars that blew
imperative horns too obviously. That was the
danger to Allen&mdash;rich young friends with time on
their hands and nothing to do. Ah, well; leave that
to Alec Landry. He was a stout man when it came
to calling halt.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone swung his legs to the floor. Lady arose
from where she had slept, stretched her great
muscles, and came toward him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; the doctor said, &ldquo;suppose we take to the
road. There aren&rsquo;t many good days left. Once
winter comes you and I will be more or less chained
to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deep eyes of the dog clung to his face. Presently,
his hand holding the hard handle-grip of
Lady&rsquo;s harness, he listened at Joe Morrow&rsquo;s bedroom
door. His nephew was still asleep. Out on
the dirt road Dr. Stone said, &ldquo;Lady, away,&rdquo; and
they turned north to where Indian summer lingered
late in the hills and the valleys were a brown haze.
By and by there was wood smoke in the man&rsquo;s nostrils,
and the distant babble of many alien tongues.
And, while he wondered about this a woman&rsquo;s
voice, old and weak, quavered at him from the
roadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your fortune, kind master, if it&rsquo;s safe near the
beast and you blind. Cross my palm with silver,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Gypsies! The doctor laughed and shook his
gray, lion head. His left hand held to the harness;
his right hand swung a light cane. Abruptly the
cane lost contact with a field fence and touched
nothing. The man said, &ldquo;Lady, right,&rdquo; and passed
through a pasture gate onto Allan Robb&rsquo;s land as
unerringly as though he could see the gate itself.
And the thought that lay in his mind had to do with
the gypsy encampment and how long it would be
before Alec Landry discovered the trespass and
roared the intruders off.</p>
<p>And now, suddenly, the stillness that seemed part
of the smoky haze was broken, and the morning was
filled with the far-off echoes of a sledge or a pick
swung against rock and dirt. The sound, the doctor
decided, came from the deep ravine that divided
the Robb estate. But when man and dog came to
the wooden bridge that spanned the ravine, there
was no sound save the gurgle of water running
among the sharp rocks far below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, down there!&rdquo; Dr. Stone called.</p>
<p>Silence! Lady stood rigid and a low growl rumbled
in her throat. The man, sharpened by an intangible
something, touched the alert ears, and the
dog was quiet. A wind sighed through the bare
branches of the trees, and all at once there was dust
and grit in his face. The grit burned like fire. He
put up a quick hand and rubbed hot, harsh particles
between his fingers. For a time he stood there motionless,
startled; and then, slowly, he moved off the
bridge with the dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>An hour later he was back on the dirt road.
Horses&rsquo; hoofs raced and pounded, and voices
shouted and halloed. Lady pulled him out of the
way, toward the safety of a hedge, and the young
people who had come for Allan&rsquo;s party thundered
past. One pair of hoofs pranced, and one of the
riders rode back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new mare, Allan?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Skipper thinks it&rsquo;s more in keeping not
to ride her until tomorrow.&rdquo; Skipper had always
been Allan Robb&rsquo;s name for his guardian. &ldquo;Did
you run into the gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor was surprised. &ldquo;You know they&rsquo;re
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I think we all know they&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s surprise increased. &ldquo;Alec, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skipper?&rdquo; Allan&rsquo;s laugh rang. &ldquo;Doctor, I
think Skipper&rsquo;s softening. Of course he knows
they&rsquo;re there&mdash;he must. Cousin Bruce, too. You
remember Bruce&mdash;forever chasing boys out of the
orchard when he came on vacation? Last night
I saw him talking pleasantly to one of the gypsy
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was Bruce? At their camp?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; down at the ravine bridge.&rdquo; Spurs touched
the horse. &ldquo;You and Joe will be over this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could keep me away,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said
quietly. The horse was gone in a crescendo of
hoof-beats, and the blind man again stood thinking
for a time before moving on.</p>
<p>Joe Morrow met him at the house gate. &ldquo;Allan
stopped and said we were to go over, Uncle David.
He&rsquo;s going to show me the mare. And there&rsquo;s a
story in the <i>Herald</i> about Bruce Robb. He&rsquo;s being
sued&mdash;.&rdquo; The boy found the story in the paper.
&ldquo;For eight thousand five hundred dollars.&rdquo; He
spoke the sum in a tone of awe.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone whistled soundlessly. How much
would a good horse cost today? Five hundred dollars?
If a man who couldn&rsquo;t pay his bills spent five
hundred dollars for a birthday present&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, do you think you could get into that ravine
on Allan&rsquo;s land without being seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody was there this morning hiding under
the planking of the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe stared. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lady warned me. Then, whoever was under
there, had a pipe. The hot grains of tobacco blew
into my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s heart missed a beat. &ldquo;You think the
gypsies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blind man shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what
story the ravine could tell. Give it a look, Joe, and
keep out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady, out of her harness, drowsed in a patch of
sun, but Dr. Stone sat with a perplexed pucker between
his sightless eyes. By and by familiar footsteps
came hurriedly along the dirt road, and he
arose and went to the porch door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s been messing under the bridge,&rdquo;
Joe reported. &ldquo;A lot of rock&rsquo;s been knocked out
and a lot of dirt dug away. Does it mean anything,
Uncle David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; the blind man said, and took the dog&rsquo;s
harness down from a peg. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we looked in
at the party.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Allan Robb&rsquo;s house was gay with noise and with
laughter. Young people seemed to be everywhere&mdash;on
the porch, on the lawn, back toward the
stables. Joe, walking with his uncle and the dog,
was conscious of curious glances and voices that
flattened out and became silent. And so they went
up to the porch to be met by Allan in the great hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you came, Doctor. Joe, I&rsquo;ll show you the
mare&mdash;&rdquo; His voice broke off. &ldquo;Bruce, here&rsquo;s an old
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe edged back a step. Bruce Robb, proud and
imperious, had often driven him from Allan&rsquo;s acres,
and he was still a little in awe of the man. But the
Bruce he met today was morose and restless, and
given to a habit of gnawing on a clipped, black
mustache.</p>
<p>Alec Landry surged down the hall. &ldquo;Hi, Doctor.
A party to be remembered. Well, why not?
It isn&rsquo;t every day a man comes of age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a day early?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked
mildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wait for the day to arrive. Meet it; greet
it; welcome it on the threshold. The old Indian
tribes had the right idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe wondered what Indians had to do with
Allan&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Symbolism,&rdquo; Alec Landry roared heartily.
&ldquo;At midnight Allan becomes of age, and immediately
he begins to exercise the prerogatives of a
man. At a minute past the hour he walks into the
library with two witnesses and signs his will. At
four tomorrow morning he&rsquo;ll saddle the mare Bruce
gave him and ride it for the first time. Ride it,
Doctor, in the dark of the night and on his own land.
Ride it through the woodland to the bridge, and
over the ravine, and up East Hill. And then, alone
on the hilltop, he&rsquo;ll meet his manhood in the dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite an idea,&rdquo; the blind man said. And then:
&ldquo;Might I trouble either of you gentlemen for a
pipeful of tobacco?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe thought they must all hear the breath that rattled
in his throat. A man, smoking a pipe, had
hidden&mdash;. Did his uncle suspect somebody here?
His hot eyes watched to see who would bring forth
tobacco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the pipefuls you want, Doctor,&rdquo; Alec Landry
roared, &ldquo;and welcome. Bruce and I smoke the
same brand. Take your pick of either pouch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor filled his pipe, and a merry group
came through the hall and Alec was swept away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skipper&rsquo;s certainly putting on a show for the
golden crown,&rdquo; Bruce said tartly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>The blind face was a tranquil mask. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruce gave a bitter laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the
<i>Herald</i>, I suppose, and you&rsquo;re wondering about
the mare. You&rsquo;ve never been a half-soled cousin,
have you? When you become the poor end of a
rich relative you play to keep in his good graces.
You heard Skipper mention the will? When Allan
dies I&rsquo;ll inherit wealth. Something to look forward
to, isn&rsquo;t it? And yet, at this minute, I&rsquo;m as poor&mdash;.&rdquo;
He bit off the sentence, and in that instant the noisy
gayety from the lawn fell away to a startled murmur
and then became a hushed silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably some more of Skipper&rsquo;s symbolism,&rdquo;
Bruce Robb jeered.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone said, &ldquo;Lady, out,&rdquo; and they reached
the porch. The silence remained unbroken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gypsy woman, Uncle David,&rdquo; Joe said
breathlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>The woman was painfully old, and gnarled, and
advanced toward the porch with the aid of a stout
stick of twisted wood. Even in the voluminous
folds of her faded, bedraggled, once gayly-colored
garments she seemed a fragile framework of bones
and of brown, wrinkled flesh. Beads were strung
around her scrawny neck; brass rings hung from
her ears. And as Joe watched, fascinated, she hobbled
slowly up the walk with the slowness of great
age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did she come from?&rdquo; Bruce demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked mildly.</p>
<p>The morose man flared. &ldquo;Of course not. Why
should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe had the feeling that, in that short dialogue,
something had been charged, something denied.
Strange premonitions grew and throbbed. And
yet his eyes were glued to the old crone, leaning
like a bundle of rags on her stick at the foot of the
porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your fortunes, kind masters,&rdquo; she cried in a
weak quaver. &ldquo;It is well to know the future, for a
cloud hangs over this house. I see danger where no
danger should be, and a bud dying as it blooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe went cold to his spine. Feet shifted restlessly
in the grass, and Alec Landry burst through the
crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this vagabond doing here?&rdquo; he demanded
roughly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Bruce gave a thin smile. &ldquo;A different sort of
symbolism, Skipper. Making prophecy. Danger,
and death, and doom. Pleasant old hag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe saw the Landry face go red with rage. Pushing
past Bruce he went down the steps, burly in his
strength, and towered above the bent, shrunken
form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not wanted here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Clear out
before I call the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bent bundle did not stir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear me?&rdquo; Alec roared. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly a clawlike hand lifted itself above the
parchment face. For seconds she stood there, and
in those seconds no one moved or spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blind man,&rdquo; she croaked. &ldquo;Hark to me.
The blind man shall see, and the wolf shall find a
thorn in the rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hand dropped. Slowly that bundle of rags
turned, slowly it tottered on its way, slowly it disappeared
among the trees. A shuddering voice said,
&ldquo;Gosh, Allan; that was creepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec Landry fumed. &ldquo;Mark me, Doctor, if
there&rsquo;s mischief abroad in this neighborhood it will
be the gypsies behind it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What mischief, Alec?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;.&rdquo; Joe was startled to find the man suddenly
uneasy. &ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; the doctor admitted blandly. Pinched
lines had formed around the sightless eyes. Lady
moved restlessly against his left leg, and Allan strove
to rout the depression of the old woman&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your fortune, kind masters,&rdquo; he mimicked; &ldquo;a
roof lies over this house&mdash;.&rdquo; He went off into a gale
of laughter. &ldquo;What a lot of rot! I said I&rsquo;d show
you the mare, Joe. Coming, Doctor?&rdquo; and the
party, recovering its voice and its holiday mood,
milled toward the stable-yard.</p>
<p>The mare, Joe saw with a thrill of admiration,
was superb. A groom had brought her out roaring
and plunging. Suddenly she was on her hind legs,
pawing the air, whistling and snorting. A girl
screamed.</p>
<p>The blind man&rsquo;s ears had etched the picture. &ldquo;A
spirited animal, Bruce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirited, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much spirit, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Bruce shrugged. &ldquo;Allan wouldn&rsquo;t thank you for
a cream-puff. He knows how to ride&mdash;he&rsquo;s proud
of it&mdash;he warms to a horse with plenty of fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;.&rdquo; The cane in the right hand
swished gently against a trouser leg. &ldquo;Even a
skilled rider might find it dangerous to ride a strange,
fiery horse in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell that to Skipper, Doctor?
It&rsquo;s his show. Anyhow, the mare isn&rsquo;t a killer. I
know horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And gypsies?&rdquo; the doctor asked softly.</p>
<p>Joe was conscious of those strange premonitions
twitching at his nerves. Bruce gnawed at his mustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might as well tell you,&rdquo; he flung out suddenly.
&ldquo;Of course I knew that the gypsies had made camp;
I talked to some of them. When you&rsquo;ve had your
own taste of being harried and pressed you shrink
from hounding others. The truth is, Doctor, I&rsquo;ve
lost practically all of what money I had a year ago.
Skipper had a hot tip on a deal and let me in. It
wiped me out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Joe saw that the right hand no longer swished the
cane. The groom took the mare back to the stable,
and the crowd went off shouting in search of some
new interest. Dr. Stone said, &ldquo;Lady, house,&rdquo; and
returned to the porch. The house seemed to be
momentarily deserted; but suddenly a voice came
from one of the rooms off the wide, center hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I can&rsquo;t&mdash;not now. Give me time. A
week&mdash;two at the most. I&rsquo;ll make good. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blind man&rsquo;s feet rang hard against the floor.
The voice stopped short, and a receiver snapped
back upon a hook. Alec Landry came out into the
hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s you, Doctor. You&rsquo;ll pardon me; I
have an errand that won&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo; Abruptly, on his
way to the door, he turned and came back. &ldquo;What
do you think of the mare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Joe who answered. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A devil. You&rsquo;ve talked to Bruce, Doctor.
What do you make of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was I supposed to make something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shook his head impatiently. &ldquo;Allan
should not have told him how much he was to inherit.
He&rsquo;s in a black mood and penniless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re letting Allan ride the mare,&rdquo; Dr. Stone
pointed out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; There was a moment of silence. &ldquo;What
else could I do? He believes in himself. Could I
risk shaking his courage and turning him into a
coward? See you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blind man stood whistling his soundless
whistle. Presently he touched the dog. &ldquo;Lady,
outside.&rdquo; The revelry of Allan&rsquo;s guests was subdued
in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going home, Uncle David?&rdquo; Joe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to the bridge,&rdquo; said Dr. Stone.</p>
<p>Dusk crept out of the sky and darkness gathered
in the hollows. They skirted a field of stubble and
plunged into woodland, and Joe could feel the hard
pumping of his heart. The bridge again! Did his
uncle expect to find something there? The murmur
of water came to them, and he lengthened his stride
and struck out ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind me, Joe,&rdquo; Dr. Stone called sharply.</p>
<p>The boy drew back. From the rear he saw his
uncle urge Lady forward until both walked at an
extraordinary fast pace. The sound of running
water was stronger now, clear and distinct in the
evening quiet. Fearlessly, without hesitation, the
blind man went ahead into the unknown, trusting
himself to the guidance of the beast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Lady reached the bridge. And then, in one swift
movement, she seemed to half leap and turn. Her
powerful body blocked the man&rsquo;s path, found his
legs and pressed him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; There was no change in the serene self-control
of the voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Uncle David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your hand. Step out upon the bridge&mdash;one
foot only, one foot lightly. And hold on to
my hand with all your strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy put a trembling foot upon the wooden
planking. The next instant, with a strangled cry,
he leaped toward the man and, even as he leaped,
found himself pulled back violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It moved, Uncle David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means murder,&rdquo; the blind man said grimly.</p>
<p>Joe wiped cold sweat from his forehead. Who
was to die? Allan? Who planned it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gypsies, Uncle David?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Quietly, without haste, the man filled his
pipe. &ldquo;Remember, they are a clan. The old
woman would not have spoken of death if the men
of her tribe were concerned in this. Besides, who
would hire them for this sort of work and risk paying
blackmail all the days of his life? I am concerned
with something else. Alec Landry called
me to witness their presence should there be mischief.
Bruce took pains to explain why he had not
driven them off. Both men may have spoken the
truth, but it is not likely. One or both of them lied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night had fallen. In the darkness Dr. Stone
smoked as placidly as though death and horror were
not at his elbow. Lady still kept her body between
him and the ravine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one with a fortune to gain,
one with a crime to cover. Do they work together,
or do they work alone? Is one innocent? If so,
which one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe spoke in a whisper. &ldquo;What crime, Uncle
David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Embezzlement. You heard that telephone talk
of Landry&rsquo;s? He&rsquo;s lost heavily in the deal that
wrecked Bruce. He&rsquo;s probably lost money that
didn&rsquo;t belong to him&mdash;Allan&rsquo;s money. Somebody
has planned that Allan shall die. Is it the man who
would be sure to become wealthy, or the man who
might save himself from jail? Who undermined
this bridge?&rdquo; Without haste he knocked the ashes
from his pipe. &ldquo;Come, Joe; we&rsquo;re going back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Once clear of the woodland Joe saw the house
across the fields brilliant with lights. Sounds of
merriment came from inside, and a dozen voices
laughed and talked at once.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone spoke softly. &ldquo;What are they doing,
Joe? Eating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruce and Mr. Landry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see them. They&rsquo;re not at the tab&mdash;&mdash;I
see them now. They&rsquo;re coming this way toward
the porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know,&rdquo; the blind man said calmly.
When Bruce and Alec Landry stepped from the
house he sat in placid contentment, and the tawny
shepherd dog lay at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allan&rsquo;s holding places for you and Joe,&rdquo; Alec
Landry said.</p>
<p>The doctor shook his head. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll stay
here. This is a night when youth has a right to
question the presence of gray hairs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in no mood for it myself,&rdquo; Bruce Robb said
curtly, and dropped into a chair to the left of Dr.
Stone. Landry sat on his right. The blind man
stretched his arms lazily, as one does who takes his
rest gratefully, and his hands fell on an arm of the
chair of the man on either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Allan rides at dawn,&rdquo; he said casually.</p>
<p>Joe had almost ceased to breathe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At dawn,&rdquo; Alec Landry repeated heartily. &ldquo;By
George, there&rsquo;s a picture. Sir Galahad with the
sunrise in his face. Get it, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plainly, Alec; very plainly. That&rsquo;s what worries
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What worries you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The picture. It&rsquo;s incomplete. First he rides
out. So far, so good. But&mdash;is he supposed to come
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the space of a heart-beat it was as though
neither man had heard; then Bruce leaped to his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Stone, that&rsquo;s a ghastly thing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ghastly business,&rdquo; the blind man said without
emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mumbling gypsy has addled your brain.
You&rsquo;re mad. I think I can find pleasanter company.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>He was gone, and Joe grew conscious of a collar
that had become too tight. Would Uncle David
let him go, or would Lady be sent to bring him
back? A burst of laughter rolled from the festive
dining-room. Dr. Stone&rsquo;s voice, brooding, came
out of the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were desperate, Alec, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desperate?&rdquo; The word was snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; desperate. The deal that had plunged
Bruce to ruin had sucked you down, too. You didn&rsquo;t
know which way to turn. Until Bruce sent up the
mare there seemed no escape; but when the mare
arrived it opened the doors to salvation. It brought
a plan. Let the lad ride out alone. Blame the mare
when his body was found&mdash;a runaway crash
through the bridge. Hadn&rsquo;t they all seen the mare&rsquo;s
wild prancings? You tried to cover yourself from
every angle. You even insinuated that Bruce might
have a reason for sending such a horse&mdash;you even
called her a devil&mdash;and whispered of Bruce&rsquo;s black
mood, and his penniless condition, and the will.
You tried to work the gypsies into the pattern. If
some sharp eye should notice something queer about
the way the bridge had collapsed hadn&rsquo;t there been
gypsies encamped nearby? You were too pointed
in calling my attention to the gypsies and their possible
relation to the future events. That was when
I began to suspect you. It was inconceivable that
you hadn&rsquo;t known they were on the land. Never
before had you permitted trespass. Why this
time?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The answer was simple. It was the will that
Allan was to sign at midnight. Without question
he was to name you executor. It takes a year to
close an estate. With Allan dead the estate, instead
of passing out of your charge, would remain in your
control for another twelve months. A year in
which to save yourself from going to prison as a
thief. A year in which to put back the money you
used to finance your own personal business deals.
How deeply did you dip your hands into Allan&rsquo;s
funds? How much did you lose? How much are
you short?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a stark, sick silence. Joe pulled at his
collar and wet his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty thousand dollars,&rdquo; Alec Landry said
hoarsely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you planned to hide it under a murder,&rdquo;
Dr. Stone said in a voice that was flat, and level, and
as cold as ice.</p>
<p>They were singing in the house. Allan, flushed
and happy, came out to the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skipper, they want you inside. That bass voice
of yours is needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe held to the porch rail and waited for what
might come next.</p>
<p>Alec Landry did not rise. &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; he said
heavily, &ldquo;when you ride at dawn, don&rsquo;t go by the
bridge. I&rsquo;ve just had word that it&rsquo;s in bad shape&mdash;the
weight of a horse would crash it down. It
might be a good idea to run your party over and
block the approaches. Some luckless devil might
wander out on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the young men were gone with lanterns,
and lights, and axes to build a barricade; and
he who had been great on Allan Robb&rsquo;s land waited
in the house for the just punishment that would
come; and a boy, and a dog and a blind man went
toward home along the dirt road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Conscience, Joe,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said quietly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember, I sat between them. One, or
both, were behind the cold-blooded plan. If, out
of a clear sky, knowledge of the plot were exploded,
there would have to be a reaction. I counted on
that. Conscience can steel itself to brazenly meet
the expected, but against the unexpected it is unprepared.
And so, when I asked if Allan were expected
to return from that ride&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Joe Morrow asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conscience spoke,&rdquo; Dr. Stone told him quietly.
&ldquo;Alec Landry&rsquo;s chair trembled as his guilty soul
cowered in fear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<h2 id="c7">THE HOUSE OF BEATING HEARTS</h2>
<p>In the short dusk of a Friday afternoon in
March Joe Morrow came toward home from
the village school pleasantly concerned with
plans for the week-end holiday. There was a hint
of spring in the air, and the hard crust of the winter&rsquo;s
snow had begun to soften. At the top of the
last rise out of the village he passed Roscoe Sweetman&rsquo;s
farm, and it seemed to the boy that the burly
Mr. Sweetman, busy outside the barn, turned and
looked after him as he passed. From there a section
of the road spread out before him&mdash;the deserted,
abandoned Farley place and, beyond that, the rock-and-timber
house which Frederick Wingate had
built and in which he painted pictures that were sent
to art dealers in New York. Queer pictures, the
village said&mdash;pictures of queer blurs and shadows,
pictures in which men did not look like men nor
did horses look like horses. Frederick Wingate, according
to village suspicion, was slightly mad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>But Joe Morrow&rsquo;s thoughts were far removed
from men who might be mad. Sometimes, if you
were lucky, you found an apple imprisoned under
the snow&mdash;a late windfall that was almost a ball of
liquid cider. He swung off the road and, back in
the Farley orchard, rooted diligently. Presently,
triumphant, he gave a shout. He had found not one
apple, but two. He bit through the skin, and the
cold, imprisoned juices oozed into his mouth.
When the fruit was sucked dry he tossed it aside
and bit into the second. And only then did he notice
how much the day had darkened.</p>
<p>And suddenly, for no reason at all, he was filled
with a creeping, apprehensive dread. His eyes,
startled, rested on the house where Matt Farley had
once lived, and he forgot to suck nectar through the
punctured hole in the apple. Often, since the house
had been abandoned, he had romped around the
wide porches and climbed over the heavy railings.
But now, in the gathering gloom, the structure had
ceased to be friendly and inviting. Against the
darkening sky this old friend of a house had all at
once become a threatening, nameless thing&mdash;a monster
of lightless windows, and locked doors, and
stark, inner silence. The boy, uneasy, began to
move toward the road. Without warning he broke
into a run as though peril clutched at his heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Back on the road he felt safe. Outside the house
of Frederick Wingate two men stood talking; he
saw, with surprise, that one of them was Mr. Sweetman.
A little while ago the farmer had been working
at his own barn, and he was not the type given
to hurry. Why, then, had he hurried over here?
The boy was conscious, as he approached, that the
talking stopped. Roscoe Sweetman called in his
slow, heavy, rumbling voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why were you running, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy gulped. &ldquo;N&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; the farmer cried.</p>
<p>But the artist only laughed. &ldquo;Coincidence,
Roscoe.&rdquo; The laugh lingered in the boy&rsquo;s ears,
amused, scoffing. &ldquo;Your uncle going to be home
tonight, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Mr. Wingate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him we&rsquo;ll be over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Joe trudged on through the snow. What was
this coincidence? Why had Mr. Sweetman cried
out, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; Why were they coming
to see Uncle David? Had it something to do with
the Farley house? Why had he fled in panic from
the orchard? Now that he was away from the
place the action seemed foolish and cowardly. It
was one thing he would not tell his uncle, for he
could not imagine Dr. David Stone, blind though he
was, fleeing from anything.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock the artist and the farmer came
to the house. Frederick Wingate called: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
get up, Doctor,&rdquo; and Dr. Stone held out a hand of
warm greeting. Lady lay at his feet and stared unwinking
at the visitors.</p>
<p>Joe Morrow stared, too. Was it the Farley
house? Roscoe Sweetman, ungainly and burly in
his leather coat, his corduroy trousers and his heavy
boots, sat uncomfortably in a chair and rubbed a
calloused hand across a stubble of beard. Frederick
Wingate, lithe and jaunty, walked the floor and
filled the boy&rsquo;s eyes. An opera cloak draped his
shoulders, his shirt was pleated, his collar was long
and loose, and a silk tie was gathered in a limp, nondescript
bow. He seemed, in his dress, to belong
to another age; and this passion for adornments of
the past was reflected in his jewelry. His watch
was old&mdash;a thick, heavy silver timepiece elaborately
scrolled that had been converted into an ungainly
wrist watch. And on the finger of his right hand
was an enormous old-fashioned ring of gold curiously
twisted and knotted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; the artist announced, &ldquo;I have brought
you a man half out of his wits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I have heard,&rdquo; the farmer said,
slowly and heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what did you hear, Sweetman?&rdquo; Dr. Stone
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was last night. I was coming home from the
village and took a short cut across the Farley place
to get quicker to my back door. I came close past
the house, and there were voices coming from the
inside. That was strange because there was no
light on the inside. I have long had a key from Mr.
Rodgers, the real estate man, so I went home and
got the key and opened the front door. From inside
came groans and cries of suffering. Then I
went and shouted for Mr. Wingate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; the doctor asked.</p>
<p>The artist shrugged. &ldquo;I brought flashlights. We
searched the house from cellar to attic. There was
nobody there&mdash;nothing had been disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Voices?&rdquo; Dr. Stone suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s imagining things,&rdquo; Frederick Wingate
said impatiently. &ldquo;There were no voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard them plain,&rdquo; the farmer insisted stonily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Them&rsquo;?&rdquo; The blind man&rsquo;s voice had taken on
a note of quick interest. &ldquo;What do you mean by
&lsquo;them&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts,&rdquo; said Mr. Sweetman. &ldquo;If it was imagination
with me, what was it with Joe when he came
running hard this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ice crept up and down the boy&rsquo;s back, and his
stomach chilled. His uncle whistled long and
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you hear or see, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you ran?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. From the orchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Mr. Sweetman said with stolid insistence.</p>
<p>Frederick Wingate laughed. &ldquo;A boy&rsquo;s vivid
imagination, Doctor. A sudden fear of the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew Joe to be afraid of the dark,&rdquo; Dr.
Stone said quietly. &ldquo;You still have the key, Sweetman?
By the way, how did you come into possession
of the key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of buying,&rdquo; the farmer explained.
&ldquo;Mr. Rodgers gave me the key so that I could look
long at the house. Before that Mr. Wingate had
the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor asked: &ldquo;Were you thinking of
buying, Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Rodgers came to me three months ago
and offered it for eight thousand dollars. It&rsquo;s worth
far more than that to a man who could use it. With
its good lines and its solid construction it has possibilities.
However, after looking it over I decided
it wouldn&rsquo;t answer my purpose. I gave the key
back to Rodgers two months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rodgers came to me,&rdquo; Mr. Sweetman added.
&ldquo;I think maybe I will buy, maybe for seven thousand
dollars, but I do not tell him. It is bad business
to buy quick and pay what is first asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t want it now,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. First I must think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>After that there was a silence in the room. Joe
looked from his uncle to Frederick Wingate. The
artist leaned against the mantel and seemed to find
a cynical amusement in watching the man who had
come with him. Strained lines had formed suddenly
around the blind man&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are afraid of ghosts, Sweetman?&rdquo; he said
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; the farmer answered heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you might buy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good land. I could tear down the house and
sell it away, some here and some there.&rdquo; Joe saw
greed gleam in the dull eyes. &ldquo;Maybe with ghost
talk around it will come a better price. Maybe I
could yet buy for three thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business first, Sweetman,&rdquo; the doctor said pleasantly.
He snapped a finger, and at once Lady arose;
and Joe, his heart pounding, hurried to get the dog&rsquo;s
harness. Frederick Wingate still leaned against the
mantel above the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going ghost hunting, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can never tell what you&rsquo;ll find on a hunt,&rdquo;
the doctor answered dryly. &ldquo;Coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the year 1934,&rdquo; the artist said, amused
again. &ldquo;Ghosts have gone out of fashion. I have
letters to write.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>The doctor slipped the harness on the dog.
Lady, alert, waited beside him for the signal to go.
Mr. Sweetman had lumbered to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Care for it, Joe?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked.</p>
<p>The boy felt the chill again in his spine. And
yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get flashlights,&rdquo; he said huskily.</p>
<p>They went up the road through the snow in
silence&mdash;three men, a boy and a dog. A pale quarter
of moon had risen, and the world was all white
silver, and even the trees seemed ghostlike and unreal.
The artist dropped out at his house to write his
letters, and the others went on to Farley&rsquo;s. The
place, Joe thought, did not look so forbidding under
the softening touch of the moon. Frost had come
with darkness, and the porch floor creaked under
their feet. Mr. Sweetman thrust a key into a lock,
the front door opened on complaining hinges, and
they stepped into the damp, black, moldiness of a
deserted, closed-up dwelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The light!&rdquo; the farmer cried. &ldquo;Where is the
light?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Joe jumped, and switched on a flash. He had a
momentary glimpse of his uncle, standing in the
eternal darkness of the blind, serene and untroubled,
and the sight gave him courage. The
beam picked out faded walls, a chair, broken and
discarded, the dusty floor, a doorway, a yawning
staircase. Outside the yellow shaft of light there
was naught but a blank, impenetrable, stealthy darkness.
Darkness, and the hushed, unbroken silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked.</p>
<p>There was a sound. At first it might have been
the whimper of a wind around the eaves of the
house. It rose, and fell away, and rose again. It
fell away to a plaintive, worried whimper. And
then, without warning, it became a human cry that
filled the house with ghastly echoes. A voice&mdash;unmistakably
a voice&mdash;sobbed wildly in writhing
anguish. As abruptly as it had risen the cry was
gone, and there was only a low, plaintive, heartbroken
lamentation.</p>
<p>Mr. Sweetman&rsquo;s teeth chattered. &ldquo;You hear it,
Doctor? From all over the house&mdash;upstairs, downstairs,
everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet,&rdquo; said Dr. Stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>There was a new sound. It seemed to come from
nowhere and from everywhere. It was gone&mdash;it
came again. A measured beat, a steady rhythm that
hammered and throbbed like an unchanging pulse.
Hammer and throb, hammer and throb! It beat
upon the ears. Hammer and throb! All at once
the sound stopped in the middle of a stroke and did
not come again. The dark house lay in frozen
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor!&rdquo; The farmer&rsquo;s voice shook. &ldquo;You
know what that was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, Sweetman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s answer came in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;I
think it was a heart beating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s throat was a cramped vice. The flashlight
shook in his hand and made fantastic splotches of
light upon the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upstairs,&rdquo; Mr. Sweetman croaked.</p>
<p>They heard the sound of footsteps on the floor
above. A child&rsquo;s footsteps. Footsteps that ran and
skipped lightly and gayly. Suddenly the sound was
gone from above and in the same room in which they
stood the same footsteps gamboled. Joe made a
frantic circle of the room with the flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; the farmer choked. &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>A new sound joined the footfalls. Joe recognized
it, and his scalp prickled. The beat of a heart! It
throbbed momentarily and was gone. The unseen
child continued to romp.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone&rsquo;s voice, low and clear, came out of the
darkness. &ldquo;Lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s light focused on the dog. Lady, her tail
whipping restlessly, had eyes only for the blind
master who had spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find the baby,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s breath came and went in short, choking
spurts. Find a ghost? He kept the unsteady light
trained upon the man and the dog. The merry romp
of invisible feet still filled the room. Lady, her
tawny body red in the beam from the flash, went
without hesitation to the nearest wall. And there
she stopped, defeated, and whined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Lady,&rdquo; the blind man said quietly.
His left hand held the handle-grip of the dog&rsquo;s
harness; his right hand thrust out the cane until it
touched the wall. He came closer and laid one hand
upon the wall itself.</p>
<p>The echo of young footsteps had stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come.&rdquo; Mr. Sweetman trembled. &ldquo;It is
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Dr. Stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Without warning the dark house was awake again
with sound. Upstairs a childish voice sang softly.
Then footsteps once more filled the room. Not
footsteps in a home, but footsteps crunching over a
graveled walk. Sounds, for a moment, became confused
and fragmentary&mdash;the icy-clutch beating of
that heart, a child humming, the wash and gurgle of
water. Footsteps again crunching gravel. Joe could
almost vision a child at play.</p>
<p>The idyllic picture was broken. All at once there
was a piercing, terror-stricken scream. With amazing
speed it thinned, waned, grew fainter, as though
somebody was falling, falling&mdash;. Abruptly there
was a heavy splash, the sound of water in commotion,
a gurgling, strangling voice calling faintly for
help.</p>
<p>Joe dropped the flash, and it went out. Mr.
Sweetman cried something inarticulate and plunged
for the porch. Outside they heard him shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wingate! Wingate! Come quick! Wingate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s voice, in the darkness, was steady.
&ldquo;Frightened, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy fought for control. &ldquo;Not&mdash;not when
I&rsquo;m with you and Lady.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good lad. Find your flash. Got it? Spot it
on the wall. Look sharply, now. Does that wall
look strange in any way, in any way at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe compelled himself to make the inspection.
&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roscoe Sweetman&rsquo;s boots thudded on the porch.
The farmer came in, panting, followed by Frederick
Wingate. Dr. Stone had moved away from the
wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; the artist demanded. &ldquo;Moans,
screams, footsteps? It sounds like a dime novel.
Let&rsquo;s hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the house now held to a soundless quiet. Ten
or fifteen minutes passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks,&rdquo; Dr. Stone observed, &ldquo;as though our
ghost has called it a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetman,&rdquo; Mr. Wingate snapped impatiently,
&ldquo;this is the second time you&rsquo;ve called me from my
work for nothing. Where&rsquo;s your ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was here,&rdquo; the farmer insisted. He appeared
to be filled with a dull surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second time,&rdquo; Dr. Stone repeated thoughtfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d call that strange, Fred.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You, too, Doctor.&rdquo; The artist&rsquo;s impatience had
given place to amusement. &ldquo;I thought better of you
than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; the blind man asked mildly. Joe
stood rigid. His uncle&rsquo;s voice had carried an undertone
that had not been there before.</p>
<p>But nothing more was said. They came from the
house, and Roscoe Sweetman&rsquo;s fumbling hand clattered
the key against the lock. In the road Frederick
Wingate paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he asked curiously, &ldquo;do you actually
believe in ghosts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe what I hear,&rdquo; the blind man said without
emotion.</p>
<p>Joe, struck with terror, hugged close to the safety
of the dog. That night his sleep was broken by
dreams&mdash;dreams of a great, monstrous heart throbbing
so that all could hear it and of strange screams
that faded into a swift, strange silence. In the morning
an east wind blew down from the mountains and
the sky was gray and overcast. Twice Joe walked
toward the Farley farm, and twice he turned back.
He saw Mr. Sweetman, hulked over the wheel of
a small car, drive toward the village and, an hour
later, drive back. And all through the morning Dr.
Stone sat with his beloved pipe unlighted in his
hands, and by that token the boy knew that his
uncle was buried in disturbed thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Early in the afternoon Police Captain Tucker and
Mr. Rodgers, the real estate man, came to the house
in the captain&rsquo;s car. Joe hovered in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; Mr. Rodgers demanded, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this
talk about a ghost at Farley&rsquo;s? Sweetman came in
to see me this morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetman?&rdquo; The blind man was intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbed it under my nose that there was no
market for a haunted house. Said you had heard the
ghost. How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Sweetman happen to be in a buying mood?&rdquo;
Dr. Stone asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An eager mood. That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did he offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yesterday, Joe thought, the farmer had mentioned
$3,000. He glanced at his uncle. The blind
man had struck a match to the unlighted pipe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We heard a little of everything, Rodgers&mdash;groans,
screams, the footsteps of a child, singing.&rdquo;
Blue smoke rose fragrantly from the pipe. &ldquo;A child
singing,&rdquo; the doctor added, and turned sightless eyes
toward the captain. &ldquo;What brings you into this,
Tucker. Planning to arrest a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost?&rdquo; Captain Tucker snorted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe in ghosts. There&rsquo;s such a thing as hocus-pocus
to steal away the value of a piece of property.
Did you know Matt Farley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rodgers and I did. A friend to tie to. Matt
was doing well here, but his youngest boy, about
four, died. It broke him up. Two years later he
closed the house and went away. Now he&rsquo;s out on
the Coast, sick and penniless, and he asked Rodgers
to sell the place and get money to him. I&rsquo;m in on
this to see that no swindle is put over on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone asked: &ldquo;How did the boy die, Tucker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fell down a well and was drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horror froze Joe Morrow&rsquo;s blood. Words
passed back and forth in the room&mdash;he did not hear
them. By and by the three men were in the road
and headed for Farley&rsquo;s. He trailed along. They
stopped at Mr. Sweetman&rsquo;s for the key.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; the farmer said heavily, &ldquo;not for one
thousand dollars would I go into that house again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d buy it though,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said mildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now. Since this morning I am told that
when you tear down a ghost house the ghost follows
you into yours. Maybe it is so. I do not take a
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; the real estate man
snapped.</p>
<p>Mr. Sweetman&rsquo;s eyes shifted. &ldquo;I do not say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house, on this drab, gray day, was bleak and
forbidding in its emptiness. Cold shadows lurked
in the corners. However, there was daylight, you
could see, and Joe did not feel the frozen terror of
last night. Captain Tucker relentlessly searched the
house. In the end he came up from the cellar with a
paper in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find anything,&rdquo; Mr. Rodgers asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cover from a magazine and a scrap torn
from a page. Matt&rsquo;s been out of here for years; this
magazine is a last August issue. How did it get
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What magazine?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called <i>Wonder World</i>. How did it get
here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetman has a key,&rdquo; the real estate man said.
&ldquo;Wingate did have a key. Either one of them
could have brought it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long did Wingate have his key?&rdquo; the
doctor asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month, probably. Painted in here for a while.
Gave me back the key at last and said it would cost
too much to change the upstairs to get a studio with
a northern light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then these things mean nothing,&rdquo; the captain
grumbled in disappointment. He crumpled the
cover and threw it into a blackened fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That scrap of paper?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a dozen incomplete lines. Something torn
out at random.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might I have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker grunted in impatience. &ldquo;I tell
you it&rsquo;s merely a scrap&mdash;&mdash;Oh, take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They emerged from the house, and almost at once
Frederick Wingate came out of his own dwelling
wearing a paint-smeared apron.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By Harry!&rdquo; he cried angrily, &ldquo;this ceases to be a
joke. Now the police are here, and next it will be
in the newspapers. They&rsquo;ll howl it up with scare
headlines, and the rabble will come down on us by
train, and bus and private car. The neighborhood
will be marked for sordid sensation. Sweetman&rsquo;s
place, Farley&rsquo;s, mine&mdash;none of them will be worth
a dollar. Nobody has heard these screams, and
footsteps and heartbeats. It&rsquo;s hysterical imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come over tonight and try my imagination,&rdquo;
Captain Tucker said.</p>
<p>The artist stormed back into his house and
slammed the door.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone, holding to Lady&rsquo;s harness-grip, went
serenely toward his home. Mr. Rodgers talked
warmly. Wingate had the right idea&mdash;hysteria. But
Joe, though silent, could still feel the tremor of his
nerves. There had been screams and heartbeats.
And a boy had fallen into a well and drowned!</p>
<p>Captain Tucker and the real estate man climbed
into the police car and were off. Instantly the unconcern
fell away from the blind man. He held out
the scrap of paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Read it, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy read the few, disjointed words on the
triangular strip:</p>
<p><span class="jr">If the</span>
<span class="jr">effects</span>
<span class="jr">sonority</span>
<span class="jr">periments.</span>
<span class="jr">By means of</span>
<span class="jr">succeeded in</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it mean anything, Uncle Dave?&rdquo; he asked,
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; Dr. Stone&rsquo;s face had become intent.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll walk into the village with Lady. You&rsquo;d
better stay here, Joe. I may be gone a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone three hours. When he returned
he was whistling softly.</p>
<p>Darkness came early out of the drab day. Joe
placed a log in the fireplace, and Dr. Stone smoked
quietly and toasted his legs in the warmth of the
blaze. At seven o&rsquo;clock there were footsteps on the
porch and a knock on the door. Frederick Wingate
walked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still thinking of ghosts, Doctor?&rdquo; he asked
humorously. The afternoon&rsquo;s ill-temper had disappeared.</p>
<p>The face of the blind man was inscrutable. &ldquo;Still
thinking,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>And then, for a time, the Farley house and the
ghoulish beat of its unseen heart seemed forgotten,
and Joe listened to sparkling talk of the days when
Mr. Wingate had been a student in Paris and Vienna.
Abruptly, in the middle of a sentence, the man
stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time will Tucker be back tonight,
Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The artist pulled back the sleeve of his coat and
glanced at the heavy, elaborately-scrolled, silver
wrist watch. &ldquo;Eight-ten,&rdquo; he said. And then, seeing
Joe&rsquo;s fascinated eyes upon the watch, he continued
to hold up the bared wrist. &ldquo;A curious trinket, Joe.
I picked it up in Austria. Keeps time to the split
second. But it has a curious trick. Do you hear it
ticking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your wrist happens to turn in exactly the right
position&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The man moved his wrist, and all at
once the boy heard the watch ticking out an emphatic,
muffled stroke. Again the wrist moved, and
the timepiece was no longer audible. The artist
laughed. &ldquo;Not bad, eh, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Joe said &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; and looked at his uncle. Dr.
Stone had ceased to smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a bad night, Doctor,&rdquo; Frederick
Wingate went on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s snow in the air. I&rsquo;d
advise you to sit snug and let Tucker do his ghost-hunting
alone. It will be wasted time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so sure of that, Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Doctor. You know how I feel
about goblins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I was wondering. Last night you
insisted we hadn&rsquo;t heard sounds. Tonight you become
more positive. You predict we&rsquo;re not going to
hear anything. Why this added certainty? Is it
because you had removed the cable running between
your house and Farley&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Morrow suddenly found himself tight and
expectant. The good humor had been washed
from the artist&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was hard,&rdquo; the doctor said serenely, &ldquo;to locate
exactly where the sound originated. Lady, though,
took me to one wall. After that, the trick was
plain. A blind man&rsquo;s touch is sensitive, Fred. I felt
the vibration in the wall. I asked Joe if the wall
looked at all strange. He said it didn&rsquo;t. Who could
break into a wall and then doctor it so it would let
out sound freely and still look untouched? Who but
an artist accustomed to skilfully blending colors?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But at first I suspected Sweetman. The man&rsquo;s
anxiety to take advantage of a ghost scare and buy
cheaply fooled me. We all stumble at times. I
should have seen from the start it couldn&rsquo;t be Sweetman.
He was greedy, but he didn&rsquo;t have the brains.
Then, too, there were no creepy manifestations
whenever you appeared. By the way, who told
Sweetman the ghost would invade his house if he
pulled down Farley&rsquo;s? You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re stumbling now, Doctor, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
the artist asked. Joe saw that his eyes had become
sharp and watchful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; the blind man said. &ldquo;The road is too
plain. Today, when Tucker searched the house, he
found the cover of the August <i>Miracle World</i> and
a fragmentary scrap torn from a magazine page.
Only ten words were on that scrap, Fred, but one of
them was &lsquo;sonority.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a word dealing with sound.
On a bare chance I dropped in at the public library.
There I learned that one Frederick Wingate is a subscriber
to <i>Miracle World</i>, and each month turns the
magazine over to the library after he has read it.
But this Mr. Wingate did not turn over his August
copy; the library, wishing to keep a complete file,
sent for the August number. There was a significant
article in that number, Fred. The librarian
read it to me. It had to do with sound effects by
radio and telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s lips were parted breathlessly. Frederick
Wingate stood as though he had lost the power of
movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not up on those things. They developed
after I became blind. Exactly how you worked the
trick I do not know. After reading the August
number you concocted your scheme. You took
your time. But in December you got the key from
Rhodes on the pretext you wanted to paint in the
house and try out the light. In that month you did
your wiring, broke through walls, inserted your
loud speakers and tuned them to the proper pitch.
The transmitting cable from your house to Farley&rsquo;s
was probably laid on the ground under the snow.
No doubt you thought you would not have to give
more than five or six manifestations. Let the ghost
talk start. After that you could take up the cable.
The thing would be done. Farley&rsquo;s property would
be ruined; you&rsquo;d buy it in for a song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do from December to March?
Practice the act? Anyway, you ran into the unexpected.
Sweetman also saw a chance to buy
cheaply. So you filled him with the fear of inheriting
a ghost. Then, when the road seemed clear,
Tucker came in. You hadn&rsquo;t expected the police.
Today, when you protested to Tucker, Rodgers
thought you were furiously indignant. I read your
voice better. You were alarmed. So tonight, as
soon as darkness fell, you took up the incriminating
cable. You&rsquo;re wealthy. Why does a man of means
stoop to small cupidities? Is it because he thinks it
clever and smart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The artist spoke hoarsely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll admit, Doctor,
that this is all rather circumstantial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was until a little while ago. Then I found the
absolute proof. Sometimes a thing becomes so
much a part of a man that he forgets he has it and
it betrays him. Do you mind telling me the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The artist glanced at his wrist-watch. &ldquo;It is
now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; His eyes, startled, stared fixedly at the
doctor. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Dr. Stone relighted the pipe. &ldquo;Might I make a
suggestion. We don&rsquo;t want Tucker in on this. I&rsquo;m
more interested in Matt Farley. My suggestion is
that you buy the place even below its worth, eight
thousand dollars. Eight thousand will be a fortune
to a man sick and penniless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wet blotches fell against the windows. Snow!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; Frederick Wingate said, &ldquo;will you believe
me when I say I did not know Farley was destitute?&rdquo;
He picked his coat from a chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
Rodgers in the morning and put down a deposit.
Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blazing log broke and fell, and sparks
showered up the chimney. So there really had been
no ghost! Relief went through Joe Morrow in a
fervent tide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&mdash;did you really have the proof, Uncle
David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The absolute proof, Joe. You saw it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it?&rdquo; The boy was bewildered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Dr. Stone stretched back in the chair and placed
his hands behind his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether
he used a telephone mouthpiece or a microphone.
Whatever he used he was right in front of it. His
hands must have been active&mdash;he had to produce the
sounds of water, footsteps, gravel. Every time the
watch began its mystifying tick&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Joe breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the blind man said quietly. &ldquo;You and
Sweetman thought it was the beating of a human
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<h2 id="c8">AS A MAN SPEAKS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hard!&rdquo; said Police Captain Tucker. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what he is, Doctor&mdash;hard,&rdquo; and the policeman
drove a smacking fist into the palm of
his other hand to emphasize the point.</p>
<p>The dog, lying in front of the fireplace, lifted
her head. Dr. David Stone puffed his pipe serenely
in the warmth of the blazing logs. The winter wind
whistled about the house, a shutter banged like the
report of a gun, and Joe Morrow jumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talks tough, Doctor, and sticks out his chin as
though asking you what you were going to do about
it. I&rsquo;ve sent out his fingerprints. Wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
if it turned out he was a bit of a gangster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have him safely in jail,&rdquo; Dr. Stone pointed
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe enough for the present,&rdquo; Captain Tucker
admitted, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t hold him forever on mere
suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not charging him with murder?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How can I? You can&rsquo;t prove a murder without
producing a body. Where&rsquo;s the corpse? Where&rsquo;s
Boothy Wilkes, alive or dead? He hasn&rsquo;t been
around&mdash;&mdash;. You pass his place every day, Joe.
When did you see him last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wednesday,&rdquo; Joe Morrow, Dr. Stone&rsquo;s nephew,
answered. &ldquo;He asked me had I seen Jud Cory hanging
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s seen him since Wednesday. That was
six days ago. That morning he and Jud had a talk
outside the post office&mdash;something about money&mdash;and
suddenly Jud yelled out that he&rsquo;d kill him.
Dozen people heard it. And since late Wednesday
Boothy hasn&rsquo;t been seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did Jud want to kill him?&rdquo; the blind doctor
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be worth looking into,&rdquo; the calm voice
drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I tried to sweat it out of him? Haven&rsquo;t
I grilled him trying to make him tell where he hid
the body? What do I get? A stuck-out chin, and
a scowl, and him telling me he&rsquo;s not a squealer.
That&rsquo;s gangster talk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>The blind man&rsquo;s head rested against the back of
the chair; his sightless eyes seemed to stare unblinkingly
at some object on the ceiling; the pale face
had the calmness of graven stone. Joe, highly excited
by all this talk of murder and a hidden body,
pulled at a thought that had occurred to him more
than once in the past. Could anything happen that
would shake his uncle out of that unruffled tranquillity?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old did you say he was, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor sat up and knocked the ashes of his
pipe into the fireplace, &ldquo;No boy is hard at twenty,
Captain. He only thinks he&rsquo;s hard. Mind if I talk
to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker sighed. &ldquo;I was hoping you
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone reached for the dog&rsquo;s harness. &ldquo;More
work for us, old girl,&rdquo; he said, and the dog looked
at him steadily. Joe wondered if she understood.
They went out to the small police car, the tawny
shepherd anxiously leading the blind man through
the snow to the running-board. Crowded into the
car, Joe and the dog in the rear seat, they rode toward
the village.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How long is it since Jud Cory left here?&rdquo; Dr.
Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven years. That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t understand.
Why should he come back after seven years to do a
murder? He used to live with Boothy; did chores
for his keep. We&rsquo;ve sent for his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jud&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; Boothy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor said, surprised: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he had
a brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did anybody else. But for that matter
Boothy was a tight-lipped man who told his business
to no one. After the neighbors reported him missing
we searched the house. Found a will and a note
written the day before the quarrel outside the post
office. The note said if anything happened to
him&mdash;&mdash;. See that, Doctor? He was afraid that something
would happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wrote that note the day before Jud threatened
to kill him,&rdquo; the blind man said slowly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Joe thought that Captain Tucker had the look
of a man stumbling over a rock he had not seen.
&ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; The captain coughed awkwardly.
&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t Jud have gone to the house several
times before that meeting outside the post office?
Certainly he didn&rsquo;t come here planning to loiter in
the streets until Boothy appeared. Anyway, the
note said if anything happened to him to notify his
brother, Otis Wilkes, at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any witnesses to the will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Oh, it&rsquo;s in his handwriting. We proved
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gets his property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This brother, Otis Wilkes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet Otis.&rdquo; Joe,
sitting taut on the rear seat, had the feeling that his
uncle had touched something hidden in the dark.
The car halted outside the village lock-up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go down with you,&rdquo; Captain Tucker
grunted. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t talk if I were there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll want Joe with me,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said, and a
turnkey led man, boy and dog down a damp staircase.
It was the first time Joe had ever seen this
forbiddingly bleak corridor of cells, and his heart
grew heavy with a sick chill. A key rasped in a
lock, and the jail attendant threw open an iron-barred
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody to see you, Cory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see nobody,&rdquo; a voice answered
harshly.</p>
<p>The blind man said, &ldquo;Lady, left,&rdquo; and followed
the dog into the cell. Joe saw a disheveled youth
who sat scowling upon a cot. At sight of them he
arose with an air of bravado. The cell door closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; the harsh voice demanded.
&ldquo;Trying to scare me with a dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s trying to scare you, Jud. Don&rsquo;t you
remember me? I&rsquo;m Dr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another cop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the blind man said gently; &ldquo;your friend.
And here&rsquo;s another friend&mdash;Joe Morrow. You
ought to remember Joe. He was only a little tyke
then, and always followed you when you brought
the cows in from pasture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe saw the hard eyes waver. At that moment
Jud Cory looked, not the murderous gangster, but
a frightened, bewildered, sick-souled boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always brought me a cake with raisins in it,&rdquo;
Jud said huskily. And then, like some wild animal
touched by danger, the youth had sprung back
against the wall of the cell. &ldquo;Hey! Trying to pull
soft stuff on me? Nothing doing, I don&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your share of bitter days, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked quietly.</p>
<p>The hard eyes wavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew your father, Jud. It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible
that his son could butcher a man for a few
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a few dollars,&rdquo; the lad cried thickly.
&ldquo;It&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe shivered. Then this had really been a murder
for a lot of dollars. The youth had choked off the
sentence and stood against the stone wall shaken by
the appalling significance of what he had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jud,&rdquo; the blind man said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to fool me
and don&rsquo;t try to fool yourself. You&rsquo;re just a poor,
miserable kid who&rsquo;s caught in a squeeze that&rsquo;s too
tight for him. Don&rsquo;t you think you ought to
tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chin wasn&rsquo;t a hard chin now. It quivered,
tried to steady itself; and suddenly, like a tree that
snaps in a storm, Jud Cory broke. One moment he
stood against the wall, still suspicious, still afraid;
the next he was on the side of his cot, his head in
his hands, sobbing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s been like in here,
Doctor. Everybody telling me I was a murderer
and asking what I did with the body. When I said
I&rsquo;d kill him I was mad. I didn&rsquo;t mean it. I tell
you, Doctor, I didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blind man groped across the cell, and sat
upon the cot, and one hand reached out and rested
on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>The sobbing had stopped. &ldquo;We&mdash;we lived in the
city,&rdquo; came from between the lad&rsquo;s hands, &ldquo;my pop
and me, and pop got sick and they said he should go
to the country. I don&rsquo;t know how it happened,
but we came to Boothy Wilkes&rsquo;. I liked it there.
Then pop died, and that changed everything. I
was nine then, nine nearly ten, and Wilkes made me
do all the chores&mdash;said I had to earn my keep. Telling
me every day I was a pauper and threatening
to send me away to the pauper farm. Then he began
to shout and yell that I ate too much. That was
when I lit out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to Philadelphia and sold newspapers.
They told me to keep out of the way of the cops
or they&rsquo;d slap me in a home because I ought to be
in school. It wasn&rsquo;t so bad in the summer, but in
the winter it was tough. Snowy days I wouldn&rsquo;t
sell many papers, and maybe I&rsquo;d have to sleep in a
hallway that night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How old were you then, Jud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About fourteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe shot a glance at his uncle. The unruffled tranquillity
was gone. The blind man&rsquo;s face was dark
with a bitter wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figured I&rsquo;d go some place where there wouldn&rsquo;t
be so much cold, so I beat it to California. There I
got jobs doing this and that, and got along. One
day, when I was out of work and feeling pretty low,
a man stopped me and asked wasn&rsquo;t I Jud Cory. He
said I looked as though I was on my uppers, and I
said I was. He said I must have gone through the
money pretty fast, and I asked him what money,
and he said he had been cashier for the bank here
and that just a few days before my father died he
was sent for, and went to Wilkes&rsquo; house, and that
my father put nine thousand dollars in Wilkes&rsquo; account
for me. It seemed pop didn&rsquo;t want any dealings
with lawyers and courts and thought Wilkes
was honest. Maybe this man was telling me straight
and maybe he wasn&rsquo;t. I got thinking it over, and
it seemed maybe Wilkes had laid it on me heavy so
I&rsquo;d light out and he&rsquo;d have the money to himself.
So I came back here, and the first time I spoke to
Wilkes I knew it was true.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the name of this man, Jud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. I got so excited I forgot to
ask, and when I went looking for him afterwards
I couldn&rsquo;t find him. Does that make any difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jud Cory&rsquo;s hands went out in a hopeless gesture.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose anybody&rsquo;ll believe me.&rdquo; He was
up from the cot, frantic, terror-stricken. &ldquo;But I
didn&rsquo;t kill him. I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said quietly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known that for the past ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Serenity had come back upon the blind man.
Holding the handle-grip of Lady&rsquo;s harness he followed
the dog up the damp stairway to the headquarters
room. There he told Captain Tucker Jud
Cory&rsquo;s story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A fairy tale,&rdquo; the police captain scoffed. &ldquo;He
got it out of a book or the movies. Anyway, it
doesn&rsquo;t explain the riddle. Where&rsquo;s Boothy Wilkes&rsquo;
body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the bank,&rdquo; the doctor suggested.</p>
<p>Again they rode in the police car, and again Lady
cautiously conducted her master through the snow.
Bryan Smith, president of the bank, admitted them
to his private office and closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wilkes case, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker shrugged. &ldquo;In a way. Cory
has burst forth with a wild&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, Captain,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said sharply.
&ldquo;Mr. Smith, did a cashier resign eight or nine years
ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight or nine years?&rdquo; The banker considered.
&ldquo;That would be Herman Lang. He resigned about
that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why he resigned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He had an offer to join a land development
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe saw Captain Tucker&rsquo;s mouth sag, but his
uncle&rsquo;s face was impassive. Bryan Smith lowered
his voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinarily, gentlemen, we do not discuss our
depositors&rsquo; business. However, there is something
I think you should know. Boothy Wilkes drew out
five thousand dollars in cash the day he vanished.
Cash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sag that had been in Captain Tucker&rsquo;s jaw
was gone. Out in the car he spoke a positive judgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your motive, Doctor. Find Boothy&rsquo;s
body and Cory&rsquo;ll soon tell us what he did with the
five thousand dollars. Anyway, we all know Boothy
kept a tight fist on a dime. Suppose he did rob the
boy. Is that any excuse for murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t yet proved Jud did commit a
murder,&rdquo; the blind man suggested gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The body?&rdquo; Captain Tucker snapped an impatient
finger. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only a matter of time. It
couldn&rsquo;t have been taken far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the village town hall a constable awaited
their coming. Otis Wilkes, he said, had arrived
from Baltimore and was now at the Wilkes farm.
Captain Tucker turned the car about. Fifteen minutes
later they swung into a driveway between trees
and skidded to a stop. On the Wilkes porch a thin,
wiry man paced back and forth restlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d know him for a Wilkes anywhere,&rdquo; Captain
Tucker said in an undertone. &ldquo;Favors Boothy in
looks, only this one&rsquo;s all whiskered. Mind if I use
Lady while you&rsquo;re here, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clues. She might scent us something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they left the car and came toward the house,
Joe Morrow had eyes only for the man on the
porch. A voice called down to them across the
railing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Tucker?&rdquo; The tone carried a high,
nasal twang. &ldquo;Land o&rsquo; Goshen, I&rsquo;ve been a-waitin&rsquo;
for you until I&rsquo;m like t&rsquo; freeze.&rdquo; The sentence ended
in a choking, sputtering cough. The man spat
violently with a burst of breath. &ldquo;Come in; come
in out of the cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house, untenanted for a week, was scarcely
warmer than the outdoors. But it was the house
from which a man had disappeared, and Joe Morrow
kept staring about uneasily as though expecting
to find a ghost. They went into a front room that
overlooked some of the land bordering the road.
Here, at least, there was sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did they get him?&rdquo; Otis Wilkes demanded.
&ldquo;This Jud Cory?&rdquo; Speech was momentarily halted
by that same choking cough, that same sputtering
outburst of breath. &ldquo;This Jud Cory who killed
Boothy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe was conscious of a sudden, intent look on his
uncle&rsquo;s face. Captain Tucker answered very, very
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you stop at the police station, or did you
come straight to the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the house, of course. Where else with
maybe Boothy lying dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know he was dead?&rdquo; Captain
Tucker demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wrote me, Boothy did.&rdquo; One hand made a
frantic reach for the inside pocket of his coat and
drew forth a folded paper. &ldquo;Boothy said it was
on him. Here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Captain Tucker read the letter aloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Otis: Like as not you&rsquo;ll be surprised to
get this letter seeing as we have not seen or
heard of each other in twenty years. But when
a man feels he is going to be took, it is natural
he should turn to his only kin. I have wrote a
will leaving everything to you, and you will be
notified when necessary. If anything should
happen to me sudden, look for Jud Cory. He
has made talk of killing me, and I think he is
the kind to do it.</p>
<p><span class="jr">Your brother,</span>
<span class="jr">Boothy.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Captain Tucker folded the letter. &ldquo;Well,
Doctor?&rdquo; he asked in poorly-concealed satisfaction.</p>
<p>The blind man&rsquo;s face was inscrutable. &ldquo;Does a
man facing death, a man known to keep a tight fist
on a dime, stop to draw five thousand dollars in cash
from a bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boothy was a-tryin&rsquo; t&rsquo; buy him off,&rdquo; Mr. Wilkes
shrilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that, Mr. Wilkes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reasonable, ain&rsquo;t it? Reckon a man would
ruther pay five thousand dollars than be laid out
stiff. What about Jud Cory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have him,&rdquo; Captain Tucker answered, &ldquo;but
Boothy&rsquo;s missing. We believe he&rsquo;s been murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then why you standin&rsquo; &rsquo;round wastin&rsquo; time
doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Mr. Wilkes&rsquo; outburst arose to a
tremulous falsetto. &ldquo;Find him. I&rsquo;ll pay a reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re starting a search now with the dog,&rdquo; Captain
Tucker soothed the agitated man. &ldquo;If you wish
to come along&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mr. Wilkes was seized with a shuddering reluctance.
&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t fitten&rsquo; I should, seein&rsquo; as folks
might say I was powerful anxious t&rsquo; find him so&rsquo;s t&rsquo;
claim the property. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Straggling hairs
again bothered his mouth, and there was another
spell of coughing and sputtering. &ldquo;Besides, I ain&rsquo;t
so spry anymore and the cold gits into my bones.
I&rsquo;ll set here by the window in the sun an&rsquo; watch out
through the apple orchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine orchard,&rdquo; Captain Tucker observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boothy set great store by it,&rdquo; Mr. Wilkes said
feelingly. &ldquo;Blasted the soil with dynamite before
settin&rsquo; out the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, Captain?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>There was an undercurrent to the words. Joe,
roused out of his expectation of a ghost, saw that
the strained lines were gone from his uncle&rsquo;s mouth
and that now the face was placid and serene. The
boy knew the sign. Once more Dr. Stone had
touched something hidden in obscurity. Light had
come to the brain that lay behind those blind eyes.
And so they came outdoors, to the snow and the
frozen ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful, Doctor,&rdquo; Captain Tucker warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady won&rsquo;t let me on ice,&rdquo; the doctor answered.
&ldquo;Search, old girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog winnowed through the snow, back and
forth, ever advancing. The quest took them past
the house, on past the summer kitchen. Suddenly
the animal, no longer advancing, began to dig in
the snow with her paws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s found something,&rdquo; Joe cried.</p>
<p>Out from under the snow Lady dragged a hat.
Captain Tucker seized it eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Boothy&rsquo;s, Doctor. Here are his initials.
B. W.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor asked a question. &ldquo;Where are we,
Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s throat ached. &ldquo;On the driveway to the
barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it strike you as strange, Captain, that
Boothy&rsquo;s hat should be found here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s strange about it? Isn&rsquo;t this the driveway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s strange about it,&rdquo; the blind
man answered. &ldquo;If somebody wanted to dispose of
a body would he drag it through the open or would
he seek cover? Might not the hat have been left
here to be found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the police officer was absorbed in a fresh
discovery. The hat was sodden with snow; and yet,
darker than the soak of water, was a stain above the
sweat-band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor, there&rsquo;s something on this hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone&rsquo;s lips formed to a soundless whistle.
&ldquo;Boothy&rsquo;s blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Captain, if that had been human blood
Lady would have shied, and whimpered, and trembled.
She would have called our attention to it,
but she would not have brought the hat out to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker flared into temper. &ldquo;Doctor,
that&rsquo;s going too far. Even a clever dog is only a
dog. We&rsquo;re going back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>The police officer carried the gruesome find to
the house. Joe stumbled in the snow. There had
been that dark stain near the sweat-band; he had seen
it, and was troubled. Was Uncle David wrong?
They crossed the porch and entered the room
where Mr. Wilkes waited, and on the instant the
man cried out in nasal horror:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Boothy&rsquo;s hat. And there&rsquo;s blood on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to the village,&rdquo; Captain Tucker
said hurriedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming back with a crew of
men. We&rsquo;ll find what&rsquo;s hidden here. We&rsquo;ll find
it if we have to dig up every foot of this farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain was gone. The outer door closed.
Dr. Stone still stood just within the room. Outside
a motor roared, and suddenly the blind man shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tucker! See that Herman Lang comes here as
soon as he arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Joe that Mr. Wilkes leaped and
jerked in every muscle. &ldquo;Lang? What about Herman
Lang?&rdquo; Another fit of sputtering and coughing
seized him, and he spat violently. &ldquo;What about
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s voice was soft. &ldquo;So you
know Herman Lang?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never heerd o&rsquo; him. Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the bank cashier who was at this house the
day Jud Cory&rsquo;s father trusted Boothy with nine
thousand dollars. Jud came here to get that
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! A likely tale. What am I supposed to do
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blind man, holding to the dog&rsquo;s leash, stepped
well within the room. Joe edged a little to the side.
He had been with his uncle on so many adventures
he had developed an instinct that told him when a
trap was to be sprung. And instinct told him a trap
was to be sprung now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might answer a few questions, Mr. Wilkes.
You and Boothy hadn&rsquo;t seen or heard from each
other in twenty years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was twenty-one years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how did you know Boothy used dynamite
to break the hardpan when he set out his orchard.
Those trees were planted in the spring of 1920,
thirteen years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe saw the Adam&rsquo;s apple in the man&rsquo;s throat
work convulsively. &ldquo;Likely I heard about it somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When Tucker came in, how did you know he
had Boothy&rsquo;s hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been Boothy&rsquo;s&mdash;Boothy allers wore
the same kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know of the blood? You were
across the room. You couldn&rsquo;t have distinguished
a stain on a wet hat. Or&mdash;&rdquo; The blind man
paused. &ldquo;Or did you know, before we left the
room, that we were going to come back with a
blood-stained hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe could almost feel the man tremble. But no
words came from the stark, startled lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine thousand dollars,&rdquo; Dr. Stone mused.
&ldquo;Simple interest for eleven years at six per cent.
Five hundred and forty dollars a year. A total,
principal and interest, of fourteen thousand nine
hundred forty dollars. Sit down, Wilkes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkes sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make out a check to Jud Cory for fourteen thousand
nine hundred forty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe expected shrill, nasal protest. Instead the man
sat there, huddled in tremulous abjection. By and
by the fingers, strong and work-hardened, began to
move slowly; and with that Joe saw a look of
shrewd, calculating cunning steal into the eyes.
He was like a man who, lost, sees a glimmer of hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor, most likely this Jud Cory&rsquo;s been a-tellin&rsquo;
you a passel o&rsquo; lies. But it ain&rsquo;t fitten to speak ill o&rsquo;
the dead, and Boothy&rsquo;s my brother and I don&rsquo;t
hanker t&rsquo; have folks a-whisperin&rsquo; about him and
makin&rsquo; light o&rsquo; his good name. Tell you what I&rsquo;ll
do, Doctor. I&rsquo;ll give this Jud Cory enough to stop
his mouth. Likely he&rsquo;ll need it, anyway, t&rsquo; pay his
trial lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of you,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said dryly.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkes wrote a check and pressed it into the
blind man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no more than fair to tell you, Wilkes, that
Herman Lang is not expected here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a snarl the man was on his feet. &ldquo;Give me
that check!&rdquo; Lady gave a warning growl, and on
the instant the grasping hand was stayed. Mr.
Wilkes shrank back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a simple matter to telegraph and
bring him East,&rdquo; the doctor said pointedly.</p>
<p>As slowly as it had come the shrewd cunning
faded out of the man&rsquo;s eyes. He sank back into the
chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Dr. Stone held out the slip of paper. &ldquo;How much
is it for, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five thousand dollars, Uncle David.&rdquo; This time
it was the boy who trembled. Five thousand dollars
was the amount of cash Boothy Wilkes had drawn
from the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signed by whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Otis Wilkes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without haste the doctor folded the check twice,
and tore it into bits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write another check,&rdquo; he ordered quietly.
&ldquo;This time write it for fourteen thousand nine hundred
forty dollars. This time sign your own name.
Sign it Boothy Wilkes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Joe Morrow the world went topsy-turvy.
Through an incredulous haze he saw a snarling man
sign a check and almost hurl it into his uncle&rsquo;s face.
As they came out upon the porch with Lady, Captain
Tucker&rsquo;s car swung into the driveway from
the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have men here in half an hour. Where&rsquo;s Otis,
Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone. Boothy&rsquo;s inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boothy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Otis, if you like that name better,&rdquo; the doctor
said pleasantly.</p>
<p>For the second time that day Captain Tucker&rsquo;s
jaw sagged. Dr. Stone brought out his pipe, filled
it, and puffed with calm enjoyment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Jud Cory told us the truth.
When he arrived with the information that he knew
of the money that was his, it was like plunging a
knife into Boothy&rsquo;s heart. Money has rather been
Boothy&rsquo;s god. The way to save the money came
with Jud&rsquo;s threat to kill him that so many persons
overheard. Boothy went to the bank, drew out five
thousand dollars, wrote the will and the note that
you found, wrote himself the letter he showed you,
and went to Baltimore to await the results he knew
would follow. When it was discovered he was gone
people remembered Jud&rsquo;s threat. And so Jud was
arrested, and you wrote Otis to come on, and the
search began for a body that would never be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boothy had it figured out nicely. As Otis he
would have five thousand dollars to live on. There
was no hurry. Let Jud Cory stew in jail. He
would never be tried for murder, for without a
corpse no murder could be proved. Public opinion,
though, might try Jud for threatening life, or for
disturbing the peace, or for something else. He
might even be sent to the county penitentiary for
nine months. All right; let him go. When he was
released he would be so sick of the game, so glad to
be at liberty again, that he&rsquo;d take the first train out
and never come back. And then, after an interval,
Boothy would reappear. What story would he
have told? Well, he might have claimed a complete
loss of memory&mdash;aphasia, as it is called. And there
he&rsquo;d be with his nine thousand dollars intact and
Jud Cory gone for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker had recovered from his chagrin.
&ldquo;I can see all that now, Doctor. But how did you
know he was Boothy? Man, he had me completely
fooled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were several signs,&rdquo; Dr. Stone answered.
&ldquo;An apple orchard, for one; a hat for another. But
the real give-away&mdash;&rdquo; He passed the pipe under
his nose and inhaled the aroma of the burning tobacco.
&ldquo;You wear false teeth, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has that to do with it?&rdquo; Captain Tucker
demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took you a while to get used to them, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the answer. Boothy didn&rsquo;t take time to
get used to them. They kept straggling out of place
and interfering with his speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Captain Tucker
cried impatiently. &ldquo;False teeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the blind man said mildly. &ldquo;False
whiskers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<h2 id="c9">ARM OF GUILT</h2>
<p>Hurrying along the shadowed road beside
Dr. David Stone and Lady, Joe Morrow
was conscious of the hard pounding of his
heart against his ribs. The telephone call from Police
Captain Tucker had been terse and abrupt, but
out of it had come alarm and revelation. The explosion
he and his uncle had heard an hour ago had not
been the backfire of an automobile, but the murderous
bark of a pistol. And Ira Close, the Foster&rsquo;s
hired man, had been shot, and nine-year-old Billy
Foster had been kidnaped. Joe gulped. He had
seen the small boy at school that afternoon.</p>
<p>Moonlight flooded the yard in the rear of Ben
Foster&rsquo;s house, and black shapes stood out in sharp
relief. Pressed against the powerful flanks of the
dog Joe strained his eyes and made them out: Mr.
Foster, agitated, walking back and forth restlessly;
Captain Tucker staring hard at the ground, and a
third man&mdash;Why, the third man was Ira Close. The
boy gave a suppressed cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s there, Uncle David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; Ira. Ira wasn&rsquo;t shot badly. It&rsquo;s only
his hand. His hand is bandaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone said: &ldquo;Lady, left,&rdquo; and the dog swung
them into the Foster yard. At the sound of their
feet on the driveway gravel Mr. Foster gave a cry
and hurried toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, Doctor, you&rsquo;re here. If you can
find him, if you can get him back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure,&rdquo; the doctor broke in quietly, &ldquo;he
hasn&rsquo;t gone to a friend&rsquo;s house and stayed for supper?
Small boys sometimes forget to come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kidnaping.
We have the ransom note. Five thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand!&rdquo; Mr. Foster cried wildly. &ldquo;Fifteen!
Any amount, so long as he comes back unharmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; said Dr. Stone, and took out his pipe and
reached into a pocket for tobacco. Amid the hysterical
panic he was controlled, steady. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re to
get any place we must try to think clearly. When
was the boy seen last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker answered. &ldquo;Four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we know he wasn&rsquo;t kidnaped until after
four. And about eight o&rsquo;clock you were given a
ransom note. That means the kidnapers were in
the neighborhood an hour ago. How did the note
get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was brought to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Foster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who brought it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ira.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone&rsquo;s hand came out of his pocket without
the tobacco pouch. Joe, startled, saw his uncle&rsquo;s
eyes turn, as though by instinct, toward the hired
man he could not see. Ira Close, always given to a
dull, stupid sullenness, shifted his thick-set, muscular
body awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent him out to find Billy,&rdquo; Mr. Foster explained.
&ldquo;The boy had been gone since four o&rsquo;clock
when he went out of the house with a plate of food
for his rabbits. I thought he might have gone trailing
after that organ-grinder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What organ-grinder?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked sharply.</p>
<p>Again it was Captain Tucker who answered. &ldquo;A
stranger, doctor. Gave his name as Pasquale Monetti.
Came to the police station four days ago and
paid two dollars for a permit. Had a monkey on a
chain. The kids have been following him all over
the village.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>The doctor said quietly: &ldquo;How did you come to
get the note, Ira?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went for Billy like Mr. Foster said.&rdquo; The
man&rsquo;s voice was a low rumble. &ldquo;Down by the
Howard&rsquo;s woodlot there&rsquo;s a bang and I know I&rsquo;m
shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right thumb,&rdquo; said Captain Tucker. &ldquo;The
bullet creased the skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It bled,&rdquo; Ira Close said unemotionally, and Joe
saw blood on the handkerchief-bandage. &ldquo;He tells
me not to move, and ties my arms behind, and puts
the note in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said. &ldquo;What he, Ira?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The organ-grinder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I have my back turned. He does not talk
our kind of American.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Captain Tucker gave a grunt of exasperation.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too thin for identification. A thousand men
within twenty miles might talk with a foreign accent.
I can&rsquo;t understand this, Doctor. If somebody
wanted to use Ira to carry a message why did they
shoot close enough to hit him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said gravely. His hand
went into his pocket and this time came out with
the pouch. Slowly, almost leisurely, he filled the
pipe.</p>
<p>Joe Morrow, groping in the dark for light,
abruptly grasped the cords of memory. &ldquo;Ira could
have known his voice,&rdquo; the boy cried, excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Captain Tucker barked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Ira talking to the organ-grinder yesterday
in front of the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him about the monkey,&rdquo; Ira said stolidly.
&ldquo;I thought maybe I might buy one for Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us that?&rdquo; Captain Tucker
flared in a temper. &ldquo;Here we&rsquo;re wasting time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my boy being taken farther away every
minute,&rdquo; Mr. Foster groaned in sick despair. &ldquo;Do
something! I tell you I can&rsquo;t stand this waiting,
waiting! Do something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said gently, &ldquo;we have already
done something. How was Ira tied, Tucker?
Tight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen them tied tighter. Didn&rsquo;t have to cut
the rope&mdash;slipped it down over his elbows. A botchy
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This organ-grinder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swarthy, with a heavy mustache. Not over
four and one-half feet tall and weighing about 135.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you weigh, Ira?&rdquo; the doctor
asked.</p>
<p>The hired man answered without interest. &ldquo;One
hundred eighty-five pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe, trying to read his uncle&rsquo;s face, found it inscrutable.
And yet the question meant something.
The pipe had gone out; Dr. Stone lighted it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to reconstruct this crime, Tucker. At
four o&rsquo;clock Billy left the house with feed for the
rabbits. After that&mdash;a blank. Did he feed the rabbits
and wander on? Did he ever reach the warren?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mr. Foster choked. &ldquo;Whatever happened
to him happened here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>And then, for the first time, Joe saw what lay
upon the ground in the moonlight&mdash;the shattered
pieces of a blue plate, scraps of lettuce and carrot,
and a boy&rsquo;s cap. Evidently, Billy Foster had never
reached the rabbit warren with the feed. While
Captain Tucker described the scene to the blind
man, Joe picked up the cap. Why, they were in
full view of the house. Could a boy be kidnaped in
broad daylight from his own doorstep?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have happened,&rdquo; Captain Tucker insisted
testily. &ldquo;Not here. The place is too open.
Probably something startled the boy and he dropped
the plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he were frightened,&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked mildly,
&ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t he run to the house? What frightened
him? Did whatever happen happen so quickly that
there was no time to run? And then there&rsquo;s something
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Captain Tucker snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cap. It would take quite a fright to pop a
cap off a boy&rsquo;s head.&rdquo; The blind man put the pipe
back in his pocket. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve kept track of this
organ-grinder, haven&rsquo;t you, Tucker? Where has
he been staying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petey Ring&rsquo;s shack on the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said, &ldquo;it might be worth our
while to go down toward the river.&rdquo; A dozen steps
toward Captain Tucker&rsquo;s car he paused. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
better have that finger looked at, Ira. Gun-shot
wounds can develop lock-jaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctors want money,&rdquo; Ira Close said resentfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a common failing,&rdquo; the blind man observed
pleasantly.</p>
<p>Joe tingled. Something lay behind those four
words. But again the bland face was expressionless.</p>
<p>Petey Ring, unkempt and wrapped in a soiled
apron, met them in the frowsy public room of this
river &ldquo;hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cap,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was just thinking of giving you
a buzz. You know that bird who&rsquo;s been penny
snatching with a monk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s mouth fell open, and Dr. Stone stopped dead
in his tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Captain Tucker demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me. I ain&rsquo;t clapped a peeper on him since
this morning. Looks to me like he&rsquo;s taken it on the
lam. You got a line out for him, Cap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain shrugged. &ldquo;Just checking up,
Petey. What time did he shove off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking me? I thought he was out working
his graft. Then there&rsquo;s a jabbering from his
room, and there&rsquo;s the monk all alone in there throwing
fits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Stone&rsquo;s voice cut in. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s his room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petey, stepping past the dog warily, led the way.
The room was a squalor of untidiness. Dirty blankets
were tumbled on the army cot bed, and a
cracked mirror stood upon a paint-chipped dresser.
The hand-organ, gaudy with cheap trappings,
leaned in a corner and, attached to it by a light
chain was a wizened, wrinkled, black-faced monkey.
The animal flew into a rage, climbed the
length of its chain and, from the top of a window-casing,
shrieked and chattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ira was right,&rdquo; Captain Tucker said harshly.
&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s throat ached. Jolly Billy Foster taken by
violence and held for ransom! Hidden away in
some dark hole, probably, homesick and terror-stricken.
He looked at his uncle. The blind man&rsquo;s
face had become intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This room reeks,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said, &ldquo;with the
stench of cheap shaving soap. Search it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; Captain Tucker asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Joe, conscious only of the stale stench of the
room, marveled that his uncle could detect the smell
of soap. He poked into the corners. Petey,
lounging in the doorway, watched the search narrowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this bird been pulling, Cap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnaping,&rdquo; Captain Tucker threw at him.</p>
<p>Petey went white. &ldquo;So help me, Cap. I&rsquo;m out
of it. You ain&rsquo;t got a thing on me. Take my oath.
I ain&rsquo;t touching nothing like that. Who&rsquo;d he
snatch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer. Lady, pawing, had
brought a ball of paper out from under the bureau.
Captain Tucker opened the wad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hair,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s blood, too,&rdquo; Joe cried.</p>
<p>The blind man whistled soundlessly. &ldquo;A shaved
off mustache and a cut lip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tried a disguise and marked himself.&rdquo; Captain
Tucker bolted for the door. They pushed past the
alarmed, agitated Petey and left him crying after
them.</p>
<p>At the railroad station a strange agent, a relief for
the regular man, came to the ticket window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you sell a ticket late this afternoon or this
evening to a man with a cut lip?&rdquo; Captain Tucker
barked the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo; The agent spoke with a slow,
maddening drawl. &ldquo;Short, dark fellow. Couldn&rsquo;t
help noticing that lip. Looked as though&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many tickets did he buy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if I recollect, he bought one. Yes; one
ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peekskill. Yes; I remember that. Just happens
that I have a married daughter in Peek&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker frothed. &ldquo;Never mind your
family. This is important. What train did he
take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agent was galvanized into more rapid speech.
&ldquo;The 6:29.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see him get on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes; I did. I happened to be looking out
the window&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he get on alone or did he have someone
with him. Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got on alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>No flicker of change showed in Dr. Stone&rsquo;s face,
but Captain Tucker was staggered. Joe was suddenly
wan and bleak. Had they followed the trail
this far only to have it fail them. And then,
abruptly, the police captain was pounding the grille
of the ticket-window with a huge fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time does that train make Peekskill? In
twelve minutes? Get that key working. I want
that man with the cut lip held. If he doesn&rsquo;t get off
the train have it searched. Give me that telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain called Peekskill police. Presently
they were out on the platform and he took off his
cap and fanned his face. Green signal lights blinked
out of the darkness down the right of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor, what did he do with the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he did nothing,&rdquo; the doctor said
quietly.</p>
<p>Joe stiffened with new hope. That tone of his
uncle&rsquo;s&mdash;? But the captain, brooding, was lost in
his own thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a slant to this I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he
said slowly. &ldquo;That boy was kidnaped in broad
daylight. Snapped out of his own yard. How
could a stranger have brought him through a village
where he was known? How could he have
been taken past his own house out to the road?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking about that,&rdquo; Dr. Stone admitted.
The blind face was again intent. &ldquo;Suppose
we go back to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Foster hurried toward them with pathetic
haste. &ldquo;Any news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The organ-grinder left for Peekskill on the
6:29,&rdquo; Captain Tucker told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve telephoned
and wired. They&rsquo;ll pick him up when the train
gets there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Billy with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain made a merciful answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ira Close came across the yard through the moonlight.
&ldquo;You want me to pick up those pieces of
plate, Mr. Foster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of them, Ira. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want Mrs.
Foster to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you his cap?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked with that
same understanding gentleness. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he
was ever taken out to the road. Now, Tucker, if
you&rsquo;ll lead me to where the plate was dropped&mdash;.
Lady, forward.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Joe could feel Ira Close beside him rubbing the
injured hand as though it pained, but his eyes were
on the man walking beside the dog. They came to
the shattered pieces of crockery. The doctor held
the cap to the dog&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, find,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Joe trembled. What now? Nose to the ground,
the great, tawny dog sniffed for the scent. And
then it moved, not toward the road but off to the
left toward a grove of apple trees. The blind man
pulled on the leash and the dog stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What lies ahead, Foster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orchard, the barn where Ira has a room in
the loft, the chicken runs, the cow shed, and Billy&rsquo;s
rabbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tucker exploded. &ldquo;Doctor, this is getting
nowhere. The boy may have gone to the rabbits.
That&rsquo;s the trail you may be following this
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the moonlight the sightless eyes were calm.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you forgetting the broken plate, Captain?
He started out with feed. Why should he go on
without it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Beside him Joe Morrow could feel the hired man
still rubbing the hand and hear the soft scraping of
flesh along the bandage. The doctor appeared to
listen to something in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going on?&rdquo; Mr. Foster cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; the blind man said with that same
gentleness. &ldquo;The night offers obstacles. We might
miss something we should see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to wait&mdash;to wait&mdash;&rdquo; The voice broke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t hold you in suspense a moment
longer than necessary. Tomorrow, at daybreak.
Have you the cap, Joe? Don&rsquo;t lose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ira rumbled a heavy &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; and passed
from the moonlight into the shadow of the orchard.
A woman&rsquo;s voice called: &ldquo;Pa! Pa! Captain
Tucker&rsquo;s wanted on the telephone.&rdquo; The captain
hurried toward the house. Dr. Stone spoke softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ira&rsquo;s been with you a long time, Foster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine years. Surly, but a good worker. A bit
gruffer than usual tonight. Billy was always a little
afraid of him; that&rsquo;s probably on his mind. And
then this shooting and the loss of his money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred dollars. He drew it out yesterday
to send to his sister and carried it in a hip pocket.
That&rsquo;s the pocket in which the organ-grinder put
the note. The money&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blind man&rsquo;s head was thrown back; Joe saw
the lips strained and tight once more. Captain
Tucker came out of the house, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news,&rdquo; he blurted. &ldquo;Our man fooled us.
Wasn&rsquo;t on the train; slipped off at one of the way
stations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Foster swayed unsteadily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he
begged hoarsely, &ldquo;tell Billy&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman walked down the driveway with
the doctor. &ldquo;That Italian may have left the train
a station or two out, and come back for the boy.
I&rsquo;ve ordered every road out of the village guarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe came away with a choking lump in his
throat. The blind man, holding the harness and
walking close to the dog, whistled an almost soundless
whistle. The boy knew, by this sign, that the
brain behind the sightless eyes had caught a glimmer
of light.</p>
<p>Suddenly, without warning, the apple-scented
peace of the night was broken by a flash and a roar.
A whistling whine filled the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop!&rdquo; Dr. Stone cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Not until he lay prone in the road did the boy
grasp the significance of flash and roar. Somebody
had fired on them from ambush. A shuddering
chill ran up his spine, and sweat stood out upon his
forehead. The moon-splashed world was silent
again, and faintly to his nostrils came the drift of
burnt powder.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone stood up. &ldquo;Another shot,&rdquo; he called
clearly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll send the dog to tear you down.
Come, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quaking, Joe stood up. They moved ahead
again, and the boy&rsquo;s nerves were torture-tight as he
waited for another flash and roar. But the silence
remained unbroken and they came at last to the
welcome protection of home.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s voice trembled. &ldquo;Why did the organ-grinder
come back and shoot at us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bullet,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said grimly, &ldquo;was intended
for Lady, not for us.&rdquo; His hand fell upon
the dog&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Old girl, somebody&rsquo;s afraid you
know too much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>In the chill dark of the following morning the
boy and the man gulped hot coffee in the kitchen.
Arising from the table Dr. Stone walked to a desk
in the hall, took out a small first-aid kit, and slipped
it into a pocket. Then man, boy and dog were
out in the road, when the first golden streak was
faint in the eastern sky.</p>
<p>Captain Tucker&rsquo;s car stood in the driveway. Mr.
Foster looked as though he had not slept. Ira Close,
his right hand wrapped in a handkerchief, went
about small chores.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone said: &ldquo;Could Ira get Lady a drink,
Foster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ira brought water in a pan. The blind man,
shifting the leash, stumbled against the dog and tottered.
Joe, with a cry of alarm, sprang forward.
But the doctor&rsquo;s arms, outstretched, had gone
around the hired man; they slipped along the stout
body, down, down&mdash;. He caught himself and stood
erect. Ira Close swore morosely and swung an
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That finger?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked, concerned. &ldquo;I
warned you. Why didn&rsquo;t you have a doctor see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fixed it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. Here; give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>After a moment of hesitation the hand was held
out. Joe watched his uncle&rsquo;s fingers move as
though they had eyes. The tweezers came out of the
kit. Abruptly the doctor&rsquo;s body was between him
and the throbbing wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fever in here,&rdquo; the blind man said; &ldquo;infected.&rdquo;
Ira Close cried aloud. Joe glimpsed a corner of his
uncle&rsquo;s face, intent, strained; then there was the
drip of iodine, and Dr. Stone stepped back. The
blind eyes were bland and serene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have Mrs. Foster bandage it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Ira went into the house. The kitchen door
slammed shut, and immediately tranquility left the
doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tucker, stay here. Joe, this way. A few minutes,
Foster; just a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back where the broken plate had lain yesterday,
Dr. Stone unhooked the leash and gave the dog
the scent of the cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, find,&rdquo; he urged. The tawny dog, as
though puzzled by the absence of the leash, looked
up inquiringly. &ldquo;Find,&rdquo; the man said again.</p>
<p>Lady, nose down, padded toward the orchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me back, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>The boy had the feeling that they hung in air.
Ira Close came out of the house with a finger freshly
bandaged. Captain Tucker gave an exclamation of
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor! Where&rsquo;s the dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady made her own answer. From some place in
the near distance they heard her deep-toned, full-throated,
insistent bark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foster,&rdquo; Dr. Stone said quietly, &ldquo;I think Lady
has found your boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two men began to run&mdash;Foster toward the
orchard, Ira Close toward the road. To Joe Morrow
the world whirled and spun. Dr. Stone cried,
&ldquo;Look out, Tucker; he has a gun.&rdquo; The policeman
leaped, and the hired man went down. With
amazing quickness brawny arms turned Ira over,
and the first shaft of sunlight glinted on a blue
barrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if there are two exploded cartridges,&rdquo; the
doctor called.</p>
<p>Captain Tucker broke the gun. &ldquo;Two,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What does this mean, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means you have your kidnaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it came that Ira Close, snarling and
venomous, sat handcuffed in Captain Tucker&rsquo;s
police car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the boy, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the barn, most likely. Not a bad idea, was it?
Snatch the boy and hide him away three hundred
feet from his home. Who&rsquo;d think of looking for
him there? Why should anybody look for him
there when the hue and cry had gone out for an
organ-grinder who had disappeared after trying to
disguise himself?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did Ira do it? You&rsquo;ll have to ask him.
The papers have been full of kidnapings and ransoms.
Probably, with a greed for money, he&rsquo;d been
turning the thing in his mind for a long time. Then
came the organ-grinder, and that brought inspiration.
But there was one point, Tucker, you failed
to take into account, and that was why I was not
surprised to learn the Italian had boarded the train
alone. A man, fleeing after a crime, does not shave
off his mustache and leave the clipped hairs behind
him to advertise his disguise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ira snapped Billy up yesterday afternoon. The
boy had never liked him; there was a momentary
struggle. The signs of it lay upon the ground.
Probably he hid the boy in the barn loft and gagged
him. With the coming of night there was alarm in
the Foster home. &lsquo;Ira, go see if you can find Billy!&rsquo;
He had anticipated that command. And so he
went forth, and managed to run a noose up his arms,
and came back with the note and a cock-and-bull
story. He was loosely tied. Did you ever see a
captive who was not tied tightly? For this Italian
to tie Ira, a taller man, he would have to put away
his gun. Can you picture 185-pound Ira allowing a
135-pound stripling, no longer flourishing a pistol,
to wind him with a rope? It didn&rsquo;t hold together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor was that the only point where the story
didn&rsquo;t hold together. Ira made positive identification
of the organ-grinder. He identified him
through a foreign accent. But he said nothing of a
previous meeting until Joe told of seeing them in
conversation. Where had that conversation been
held? Outside the bank. Not significant in itself,
but strikingly significant when we find Ira suddenly
announcing to Foster that he had drawn three hundred
dollars from the bank to send to his sister and
that it had been stolen from his pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your guess about that three hundred
dollars, Tucker? Mine is that it went to the organ-grinder.
The Italian is guilty of no wrong. All he
knows is that a stranger offered him three hundred
dollars to shave off his mustache, abandon his organ
and monkey, disappear quietly and leave the train
before reaching the station for which he had purchased
a ticket. Why did Ira tell us about the three
hundred dollars? What&rsquo;s your guess, Tucker?
Mine is that he was suddenly touched with a cold
fear. The withdrawal of the money was a matter
of record at the bank. The money was taken out
the day of the kidnaping, the day of the organ-grinder&rsquo;s
disappearance. These facts might have
given rise to a few unpleasant questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe, breathless, looked at Captain Tucker. The
policeman frowned doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about that shot in the finger, Doctor? Do
you mean he shot himself?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your guess?&rdquo; Dr. Stone asked mildly.
&ldquo;Mine is that, when he was sent out to look for
Billy, he fired a shot in the air as an after-thought.
Do you remember, when we got there, that his hand
pained? He kept rubbing it as though it throbbed.
Infection doesn&rsquo;t set in so quickly, Captain; there
must be a period of incubation. He had cut that
finger earlier in the day. He objected to going to
a doctor even after I warned him of lock-jaw.
Why? Because he didn&rsquo;t fear the lock-jaw that
may follow a gun-shot wound. Because he knew
that no doctor would look at that wound and believe
it came from a bullet. Of course, he let me handle
it; but, then, I am blind. He figured I didn&rsquo;t count.
My guess is that, in running the rope over his arms,
he reopened a wound he had received earlier in the
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Eternal,&rdquo; Captain Tucker burst out,
&ldquo;this seems to be nothing but guesses. You guess
this and you guess that. How about a few facts.
We have placed this man in irons. If Billy isn&rsquo;t
found you and I may discover ourselves in a sweet
peck of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice called from the house: &ldquo;Captain Tucker!
Telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain mounted the porch steps. The doctor,
fishing out his pipe, methodically stuffed it with
tobacco.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said musingly, &ldquo;why
you didn&rsquo;t light out last night, Ira, after trying to
shoot Lady. Afraid to run and lose five thousand
dollars, and afraid to stay and be caught. You were
in one sweet peck of trouble, weren&rsquo;t you, Ira?&rdquo;
Ira said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How were you going to work it? Collect the
money and then get word to them where to find the
boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hired man glared in impotent fury.</p>
<p>Captain Tucker, looking slightly dazed, came
back to the car. &ldquo;They picked up our Italian in a
small village fifteen miles above Peekskill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search him, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they,&rdquo; the doctor asked mildly, &ldquo;find three
hundred dollars in his pocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred dollars to the penny in one roll.&rdquo;
The captain fanned his face with his uniform cap.
Abruptly the motion of the cap stopped. &ldquo;Look
here, Doctor; you said you found the first clew in
that injured hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first clew and the last,&rdquo; the doctor told
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last? Did you find something else when
you dressed that finger a little while ago?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>The blind man puffed serenely on the pipe. &ldquo;I
found a nasty cut and something foreign imbedded
in the cut. It had set up the infection; I could feel
it under the pressure of my fingers. I took it out
with the tweezers. Something hard and gritty,
Captain. I haven&rsquo;t seen it; it&rsquo;s safely stowed away in
my pocket. But I&rsquo;ll stake my soul it&rsquo;s a chipped
splinter from a broken blue plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Joe Morrow saw Lady and Mr.
Foster emerge from the orchard, and the man carried
a small boy in his arms.</p>
